    <h1 class="article title">Managing Humans</h1><p class="article date">2017-05-29</p></section><article class="article markdown-body">

<p>Michael Loop has worked as a manager at various companies in silicon valley, and his stories and lessons in <a href="http://managinghumans.com/"><em>Managing Humans</em></a> are really helpful. Here are some miscellaneous takeaways from my recent reading.</p>

<h3 id="every-company-probably-has-big-problems">Every Company (Probably) Has Big Problems</h3>

<p>Turns out I&rsquo;ve fallen prey to the &ldquo;grass is always greener&rdquo; fallacy. I realize that no company is perfect, but I&rsquo;ve always worked at companies that seem to have pretty big problems and I always imagine that there&rsquo;s some company somewhere in Silicon Valley that &mdash; while imperfect &mdash; &ldquo;has it&rsquo;s shit together&rdquo; on the fundamentals.</p>

<p>Since Loop actually worked at some pretty big companies in the Valley &mdash; e.g., Slack, Palantir, Apple, and Netscape &mdash; his experiences and commentary at a few points in <em>Managing Humans</em> suggest otherwise:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hate meetings. Everyone hates them because we&rsquo;ve all been to so many that have sucked unequivocally that we now walk into a conference room, sit down with our arms folded, and think, &ldquo;OK, how long until this one is officially a waste of my time? How long until this one sucks?&rdquo; And then it does. Time is wasted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out meetings are terrible everywhere. Somehow, even the folks in Silicon Valley haven&rsquo;t figured out how to ensure that meetings don&rsquo;t waste our time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[After a non-debatable mandate was given by the VP], as predicted, the team freaked&hellip;We had a good solid week of organizational disarray and then we got back to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out people everyone don&rsquo;t like being told what to do, and that even the folks in Silicon Valley don&rsquo;t trust their leadership enough to swallow a mandate without a week&rsquo;s worth of &ldquo;organizational disarray.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In high tech, we&rsquo;re all in an incredible fucking hurry. We&rsquo;re working against an unreasonable deadline and we&rsquo;re over-committed on features. As a manager, your job is that of bullshit umbrella.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here he&rsquo;s talking about how managers ought to shield their employees from the bullshit of managementese, a language that supposedly facilities communication across departments. My annotation on this comment at this point of the book was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of how Loop presumed that there&rsquo;s bullshit I&rsquo;m the org. It&rsquo;s the backdrop of this book in a lot of ways. Another title for the book could be &ldquo;Managing Bullshit&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another self-explanatory, shocking tale of political machinations in an organization:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe the execs won&rsquo;t fire him because of the perception he has essential knowledge, but, I guarantee, those who are dependent on his black box of knowledge are concocting a devious plan to replace him and his knowledge because they want to grow . Right this second, three guys down the hall have rewritten Fez&rsquo;s code in C and they&rsquo;re secretly demonstrating their work to interested parties. They are building support, they are building a revolution, and they&rsquo;re not going to stop until the person who is hindering their growth is gone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, this story didn&rsquo;t happen <em>exactly</em> as its told, but Loop has based these stories on real life. So, at some the best companies I know about, execs are out of touch and team members are back stabbing each other. Amazing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my favorite. Loop explains an engineer&rsquo;s risk factor for being outsourced by talking about company quality along two dimensions: process and product. He actually discusses 3 of the 4 possible states: lousy process / lousy product, lousy process / good product, good process / lousy product. The last possible state &mdash; good process / good product &mdash; he merely quips, &ldquo;Wow. Where do you work?&rdquo; Of course, this suggests that even the &ldquo;great&rdquo; companies in Silicon Valley often get either process or product wrong.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-out-of-terrible-meetings">How to Get out of Terrible Meetings</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a whole chapter on this. It was so refreshing to read someone being so candid about how much BS is typically involved with meetings.</p>

<p>The basic strategy he outlines is to identify what type of meeting you&rsquo;re in and then to just give &ldquo;the players&rdquo; what they want.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;informational meetings,&rdquo; the players are listeners and the talkers. Talkers just want to convey information. This means that you need to tell people who are trying to debate the issue to schedule a follow up and make sure they don&rsquo;t invite you.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;conflict resolution meetings,&rdquo; there are &ldquo;pros&rdquo; and &ldquo;cons.&rdquo; Pros are getting what they want. Cons are getting screwed. Getting out of this meeting requires that someone communicate a set of concrete steps to help the cons feel less screwed.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this taxonomy meetings and accompanying exit strategies are exhaustive, but they&rsquo;re a great start.</p>

<h3 id="why-i-m-occasionally-cranky-at-work">Why I&rsquo;m Occasionally Cranky at Work</h3>

<p>In &ldquo;Incrementalists and Completionists,&rdquo; Loop divies folks up into two camps. &ldquo;Completionists&rdquo; have vision and they have strong opinions about how to solve a problem &ldquo;The Right Way&trade;.&rdquo; They are big on solving the problem completely. Incrementalists, as their name implies, are more about hacks and gerry-rigs.</p>

<p>Loop does a great job about going over the pros and cons of type, which was great for me to read because &mdash; for better or worse &mdash; I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;completionist&rdquo; and &ldquo;incrementalists&rdquo; often annoy me. That wasn&rsquo;t the best part about the chapter though. The best part for me was this passage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With all of their strategic vision, &ldquo;completionists&rdquo; often lack common corporate and people sense. Yes, they have a five-year technical roadmap in their heads, but they have nary a clue how to start pushing that agenda with the 12 different people who need to get on board to make anything happen. This is why &ldquo;completionists&rdquo; often get incorrectly labeled as curmudgeons. Sure, they&rsquo;re cranky, but it&rsquo;s not cranky for crankiness&rsquo;s sake, it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t have the communication and people skills to convince the company of the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read that and thought, &ldquo;Wow. That&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; Most of the time, thinking about how to manage people is scary and complicated for me, so I often prefer to stick to managing bits. It turns out that for &ldquo;completionists&rdquo; like me, this is a recipe for crankiness.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Loop&rsquo;s book helped me adjust my expectations about working in software companies a little bit. Less pretentiously, the book helped me grow up a little. I recommend it.</p>
