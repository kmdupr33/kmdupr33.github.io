&lt;p&gt;Michael Loop has worked as a manager at various companies in silicon valley, and his stories and lessons in &lt;a href=&#34;http://managinghumans.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Managing Humans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are really helpful. Here are some miscellaneous takeaways from my recent reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;every-company-probably-has-big-problems&#34;&gt;Every Company (Probably) Has Big Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen prey to the &amp;ldquo;grass is always greener&amp;rdquo; fallacy. I realize that no company is perfect, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always worked at companies that seem to have pretty big problems and I always imagine that there&amp;rsquo;s some company somewhere in Silicon Valley that &amp;mdash; while imperfect &amp;mdash; &amp;ldquo;has it&amp;rsquo;s shit together&amp;rdquo; on the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Loop actually worked at some pretty big companies in the Valley &amp;mdash; e.g., Slack, Palantir, Apple, and Netscape &amp;mdash; his experiences and commentary at a few points in &lt;em&gt;Managing Humans&lt;/em&gt; suggest otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate meetings. Everyone hates them because we&amp;rsquo;ve all been to so many that have sucked unequivocally that we now walk into a conference room, sit down with our arms folded, and think, &amp;ldquo;OK, how long until this one is officially a waste of my time? How long until this one sucks?&amp;rdquo; And then it does. Time is wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out meetings are terrible everywhere. Somehow, even the folks in Silicon Valley haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to ensure that meetings don&amp;rsquo;t waste our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[After a non-debatable mandate was given by the VP], as predicted, the team freaked&amp;hellip;We had a good solid week of organizational disarray and then we got back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out people everyone don&amp;rsquo;t like being told what to do, and that even the folks in Silicon Valley don&amp;rsquo;t trust their leadership enough to swallow a mandate without a week&amp;rsquo;s worth of &amp;ldquo;organizational disarray.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high tech, we&amp;rsquo;re all in an incredible fucking hurry. We&amp;rsquo;re working against an unreasonable deadline and we&amp;rsquo;re over-committed on features. As a manager, your job is that of bullshit umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here he&amp;rsquo;s talking about how managers ought to shield their employees from the bullshit of managementese, a language that supposedly facilities communication across departments. My annotation on this comment at this point of the book was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another example of how Loop presumed that there&amp;rsquo;s bullshit I&amp;rsquo;m the org. It&amp;rsquo;s the backdrop of this book in a lot of ways. Another title for the book could be &amp;ldquo;Managing Bullshit&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another self-explanatory, shocking tale of political machinations in an organization:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the execs won&amp;rsquo;t fire him because of the perception he has essential knowledge, but, I guarantee, those who are dependent on his black box of knowledge are concocting a devious plan to replace him and his knowledge because they want to grow . Right this second, three guys down the hall have rewritten Fez&amp;rsquo;s code in C and they&amp;rsquo;re secretly demonstrating their work to interested parties. They are building support, they are building a revolution, and they&amp;rsquo;re not going to stop until the person who is hindering their growth is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this story didn&amp;rsquo;t happen &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; as its told, but Loop has based these stories on real life. So, at some the best companies I know about, execs are out of touch and team members are back stabbing each other. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my favorite. Loop explains an engineer&amp;rsquo;s risk factor for being outsourced by talking about company quality along two dimensions: process and product. He actually discusses 3 of the 4 possible states: lousy process / lousy product, lousy process / good product, good process / lousy product. The last possible state &amp;mdash; good process / good product &amp;mdash; he merely quips, &amp;ldquo;Wow. Where do you work?&amp;rdquo; Of course, this suggests that even the &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo; companies in Silicon Valley often get either process or product wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-get-out-of-terrible-meetings&#34;&gt;How to Get out of Terrible Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a whole chapter on this. It was so refreshing to read someone being so candid about how much BS is typically involved with meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic strategy he outlines is to identify what type of meeting you&amp;rsquo;re in and then to just give &amp;ldquo;the players&amp;rdquo; what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;informational meetings,&amp;rdquo; the players are listeners and the talkers. Talkers just want to convey information. This means that you need to tell people who are trying to debate the issue to schedule a follow up and make sure they don&amp;rsquo;t invite you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;conflict resolution meetings,&amp;rdquo; there are &amp;ldquo;pros&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cons.&amp;rdquo; Pros are getting what they want. Cons are getting screwed. Getting out of this meeting requires that someone communicate a set of concrete steps to help the cons feel less screwed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think this taxonomy meetings and accompanying exit strategies are exhaustive, but they&amp;rsquo;re a great start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-i-m-occasionally-cranky-at-work&#34;&gt;Why I&amp;rsquo;m Occasionally Cranky at Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;Incrementalists and Completionists,&amp;rdquo; Loop divies folks up into two camps. &amp;ldquo;Completionists&amp;rdquo; have vision and they have strong opinions about how to solve a problem &amp;ldquo;The Right Way&amp;trade;.&amp;rdquo; They are big on solving the problem completely. Incrementalists, as their name implies, are more about hacks and gerry-rigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loop does a great job about going over the pros and cons of type, which was great for me to read because &amp;mdash; for better or worse &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;m a &amp;ldquo;completionist&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;incrementalists&amp;rdquo; often annoy me. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best part about the chapter though. The best part for me was this passage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of their strategic vision, &amp;ldquo;completionists&amp;rdquo; often lack common corporate and people sense. Yes, they have a five-year technical roadmap in their heads, but they have nary a clue how to start pushing that agenda with the 12 different people who need to get on board to make anything happen. This is why &amp;ldquo;completionists&amp;rdquo; often get incorrectly labeled as curmudgeons. Sure, they&amp;rsquo;re cranky, but it&amp;rsquo;s not cranky for crankiness&amp;rsquo;s sake, it&amp;rsquo;s because they don&amp;rsquo;t have the communication and people skills to convince the company of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read that and thought, &amp;ldquo;Wow. That&amp;rsquo;s me.&amp;rdquo; Most of the time, thinking about how to manage people is scary and complicated for me, so I often prefer to stick to managing bits. It turns out that for &amp;ldquo;completionists&amp;rdquo; like me, this is a recipe for crankiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loop&amp;rsquo;s book helped me adjust my expectations about working in software companies a little bit. Less pretentiously, the book helped me grow up a little. I recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is an Object Graph?</title>
      <link>https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/note/what-is-an-object-graph/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2017 16:12:32 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/note/what-is-an-object-graph/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I hear the word &amp;ldquo;graph,&amp;rdquo; I always think of graphs on a cartesian coordinate system. That&amp;rsquo;s not what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about here. Perhaps the easiest way of introducing graphs is to look at a visual representation of one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/images/graph.svg&#34; alt=&#34;graph&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are we looking at here? We see a set of objects represented by circles. The set is [6, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also see that a subset of those objects have some relationship to one another, which is represented by the lines. These relationships form another set of the related pairs. 6 and 4 are connected, so that&amp;rsquo;s one pair: (6,4). (4, 3) is another pair, since those two circles are connected. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wind up with this set: [(6, 4), (4, 5), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (3, 2)].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a graph is a set of objects that has at least one subset of objects which are interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some graphs are directed graphs. Their visual representation is similar to ordinary, undirected graphs, except that they have arrows instead of lines connected the circles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/images/directed-graph.svg&#34; alt=&#34;directed graph&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have our same old set of objects ([6, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2]), but this time the pairs represented by the lines are ordered. (6, 4), not (4, 6) would be in the set of ordered pairs because of the direction of the arrow. (2, 1) wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make the cut, again because of the direction of the arrow. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wind up with this set of ordered pairs: [(6, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (1, 2), (2, 5), (2, 3), (3, 4)].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok. Enough abstract stuff. Let&amp;rsquo;s reel this back in to programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying graphs consist partially of sets of objects. This may be confusing because I don&amp;rsquo;t mean a programmer&amp;rsquo;s object. Sorry. English is messy sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I mean &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo; as an abstraction over particular things. You could have a graph of people, tasks, or countries. These are all graphs of &amp;ldquo;objects.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also have a graph whose objects are a programmer&amp;rsquo;s objects. This graph would be directed, and the directed relationships between those objects could between dependency relationships: an arrow pointing from X to Y would signify that in order to build object Y, you first have to construct object X. In that case, you&amp;rsquo;d have an object graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this piece of code Json parsing code from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/google/iosched/blob/e8c61e7e23f74aa6786696dad22e5136b423a334/server/src/main/java/com/google/samples/apps/iosched/server/schedule/input/fetcher/RemoteJsonHelper.java&#34;&gt;Google I/O app&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;JsonReader reader &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; JsonReader&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; InputStreamReader&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;stream&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Charset&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #7D9029&#34;&gt;forName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #BA2121&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an object graph here. We have a set of Java objects: [&lt;code&gt;JsonReader&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;InputStreamReader&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Charset&lt;/code&gt;]. We also have a set of directed dependency relationships between these objects. For example, to build an &lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt;, you have to build a &lt;code&gt;Charset&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might represent this object graph by placing the class names of the instances of objects in the circles that represent our graph&amp;rsquo;s objects and placing arrows indicating the order in which our Java objects need to be constructed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/images/object-graph.svg&#34; alt=&#34;object graph&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the Java objects represented in this graph don&amp;rsquo;t have any circular dependencies. This means that there are no cycles in the graph. If you follow the direction of the arrows, there&amp;rsquo;s no way to go backwards. The graph is acyclic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what we have here is a directed acyclic graph or a &amp;ldquo;DAG,&amp;rdquo; which &amp;ndash; fun fact &amp;ndash; is where the name &amp;ldquo;Dagger&amp;rdquo; comes from.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Object Thinking&#39;s Intro</title>
      <link>https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/note/object-thinkings-intro/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2017 08:57:08 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Object Thinking&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s introduction begins with talking about the ongoing crisis in software:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time: 1968. A software crisis has been declared. Part of the crisis derives from the fact that more software is needed than there are developers to produce it. The other part of the crisis is the abysmal record of development efforts. More than half of the projects initiated are canceled, and less than 20 percent of projects are successfully completed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, things are a bit better because we have more developers, but West seems to think that things are still looking pretty bad. Bad in what way? Well, this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still the case that almost half of all projects initiated are not completed. Those that are completed almost always incur significant cost overruns. Quality—the lack thereof—is still a major issue. Bloated, inefficient, bug-ridden, user-unfriendly, and marginally useful—these are still common adjectives used to describe software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. Unfortunately, all of this resonates with my limited experience in software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the intro goes on to make a few major points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main responses to the software crisis: software engineering and agile. Software engineering is about better process and tools through formalization. XP/Agile is about creating better software developers, which, in turn, leads to better software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software engineering is the dominant response to the crisis, and its not working to resolve the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agile &amp;ndash; and more specifically XP &amp;ndash; is inextricably linked with OO thinking and programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These points are not obvious, which is fine because that&amp;rsquo;s partially what makes them interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-sides&#34;&gt;Two sides&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been in software that long, so its hard for me to take seriously the idea that there is some sort of war going on between formalists and agile folks. West goes on the quote lots of folks that seem to be engaged in said war, and a quick search of Beck&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Extreme Programming&lt;/em&gt; book reveals that it generated quite a stir when it was first published, but I still have a hard time picturing this struggle between the two groups. Its never something that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard older programmers talk about in my circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this and you&amp;rsquo;ve got personal experience with this struggle, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear your experience.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;software-engineering-is-sucking&#34;&gt;Software Engineering is sucking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;West seems to paint software engineering as the dominant response to the software crisis. That seems plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At every job I&amp;rsquo;ve held, whenever software quality is poor, someone decides that we need to improve our processes. Ironically, this happens in the form of an agile coach or training session. Agile, according to West, is supposed to be people-focused, but that&amp;rsquo;s definitely not how I&amp;rsquo;ve felt when I&amp;rsquo;ve attended (and even perpetrated) &amp;ldquo;agile&amp;rdquo; training sessions. Although it&amp;rsquo;s ironic, this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprising given the &amp;ldquo;raspberry jam effect&amp;rdquo; and the fact Kent Beck has talked about how the whole agile movement has become something he doesn&amp;rsquo;t even recognize.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That software engineering is directly responsible for quality problems is less obvious. I read an article a while back that suggested that, deep down, our leaders don&amp;rsquo;t really care about quality; there just aren&amp;rsquo;t enough economic incentives for them to care about the buggy experiences or inelegant code, for example. That seems plausible to me. If that&amp;rsquo;s true, I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what that does to West&amp;rsquo;s project in his book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;link-between-oo-and-agile&#34;&gt;Link between OO and Agile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For West,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XP cannot be understood, and those practicing XP will not realize the full potential of the approach, until they understand object thinking and the shared historical and philosophical roots of both object thinking and XP core values and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its hard to see how this could be true, especially because the link between OO and XP isn&amp;rsquo;t emphasized in any of the seminal texts on XP, a fact that West points out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms object and object-oriented do not appear in any of the first five books in the Addison-Wesley XP series—except once, and that occasion points to an incorrect page in the text. However, object vocabulary and concepts are abundantly evident. This discrepancy merely confirms that object thinking is presupposed by those advocating XP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am just at the beginning of the book, so I&amp;rsquo;ll have to revisit this. For now, since I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go back and read all of those books, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to have to take West&amp;rsquo;s word for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a actually bit tricky to just trust West on this because it seems like West&amp;rsquo;s book exists on a island, that is, without the endorsement or mention from any of the founding members of the agile alliance. Contrast this with a book like, &lt;em&gt;Domain Driven Design&lt;/em&gt;, for example, that is explicitly praised by both Kent Beck and Martin Fowler, even though its written by someone who wasn&amp;rsquo;t at the founding of agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its in one of the segments in the &amp;ldquo;Is TDD Dead&amp;rdquo; series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
