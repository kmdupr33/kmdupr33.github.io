<p>Unit testing your Android apps can be extremely difficult.

The many folks who responded to my introductory post, moreover, seemed to reinforce my claim that Android unit testing is tough:</p>

<p>So, Android unit testing is hard. That much is clear. Why Android unit testing is so difficult, however, is less clear. Its true that a part of the difficulty with Android unit testing has to do with the nonsense that you have to overcome to get Roboletric started so that you can run your tests at a decent speed, but I think that there‚Äôs a deeper reason why we are having a hard time testing our applications: the way that Google has written the Android SDK and the way that Google encourages us to structure our applications makes testing difficult and, in some cases, impossible.</p>
<p>I realize that this is a bold claim, so I will spend the entire post trying to establish it. In the following post, I‚Äôll try to say more about how the ‚Äústandard‚Äù way of developing Android applications encourages us to write code that is difficult/impossible to write sensible unit tests against. These posts are a part of a series in which I‚Äôm exploring the viability of enhancing the testability of Android applications by restructuring them so that application code does not directly depend on the Android SDK. Showing why the standard architecture for Android development makes testing difficult will both motivate and inform my alternative proposal for structuring Android applications, a proposal that I will outline in the fourth post of the series.</p>
<h1 id="a-seemingly-simple-test-case">A (Seemingly) Simple Test Case</h1>
<p>To see why unit testing in Android is so difficult, let‚Äôs start by looking at a simple test case. I‚Äôll be using source code from Google‚Äôs IOsched app because, as I pointed out in my first post, that app is supposed to serve as a model for Android developers.</p>
<p>The IOsched app has a IO session detail screen that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/screenshot-0646am-apr-17-2015.png"target="_blank"><img  src="http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/screenshot-0646am-apr-17-2015.png?w=169"
        alt="Screenshot (06:46AM, Apr 17, 2015)"/></a></p>
<p>Notice that the detail screen has a ‚Äú+‚Äù button that allows users to add the session to their calendar. That plus button turns to a ‚Äúcheck‚Äù button if they‚Äôve added the session to their calendar. If they tap the ‚Äúcheck‚Äù button again, the session will be removed from their calendar. The state of the button is (confusingly) stored in an instance variable called mStarred, so depending on the state of this button, the Activity will launch a Service that adds or removes that session to the user‚Äôs calendar in its onStop() method:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/kmdupr33/4c90e155dcaf6c4e0147.js"></script>

<p>This seems like a sensible piece of code to write a unit test against. Here‚Äôs the problem: you <em>can‚Äôt</em> write a unit test against this code. In order to see why, we‚Äôll have to take a step back from Android and think a bit about what makes code testable in general.</p>
<p>The three steps of a unit test, as we all know, are arrange, act, and assert. In order to successfully perform the assert-step in our test, we need access to <em>the state of our program that was changed as a result of the code executed in the act-step of the test</em>. Let‚Äôs call this state the ‚Äúpost-act-state.‚Äù For unit tests, there‚Äôs only three ways that we can access the post-act-state.</p>
<p>The first way we can access the post-act-state is to check the return value of the method that executed during the act-step of the test. Writing tests against these methods is easy:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/kmdupr33/0446675a4accb8b4fcf1.js"></script>

<p>The second way to get a handle on your post-act-state is to get a reference to some publicly accessible property of the object being tested, and to assert that the state of that property is what you expect:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/kmdupr33/830046fbad2aca2b9531.js"></script>

<p>The final way to assert that your post-act-state meets your expectations is check the state of the object‚Äôs injected dependencies. These dependencies may not be publicly accessible, but because you inject them during your test method, you have a reference to them:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/kmdupr33/03c9e003d2c3c7649297.js"></script>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve listed all of the ways that we can complete the assert-step of a unit test, we‚Äôre in a position to see why the above Android code is untestable: there‚Äôs simply no way for us to complete the assert-step of a unit test against the <code>onStop()</code> method. <code>onStop()</code> doesn‚Äôt have a return value. There‚Äôs no publicly accessible property of <code>SessionDetailActivity</code> that will help us verify that the <code>SessionCalendarService</code> has been launched with the correct instructions. Finally, the code that launches the <code>SessionCalendarService</code> is not code that belongs to a dependency that‚Äôs been injected into <code>SessionDetailActivity</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it gets worse than this. It is also impossible to complete the arrange-step of a unit-test for <code>onStop()</code>. In order to complete the arrange-step of a unit test, you must be able to alter any conditions that affect the post-act-state of your program. I will call these conditions ‚Äúpre-act-state.‚Äù Since there‚Äôs no way to change the pre-act-state for <code>onStop()</code>, we can‚Äôt unit test it.</p>
<p>The pre-act-state within <code>onStop()</code> is the mInitStarred boolean. Again, here‚Äôs the source for <code>onStop()</code>:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/kmdupr33/4c90e155dcaf6c4e0147.js"></script>

<p>This boolean is set in a callback method that‚Äôs executed after a <code>ContentProvider</code> query has completed:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/kmdupr33/325d480ee63848412748.js"></script>

<p>There‚Äôs a reason <code>mInitStarred</code> is initialized in a Loader callback. If a user adds a session to their calendar and navigates away from the <code>SesssionDetailActivity</code>, the flag indicating whether the session is a part of a user‚Äôs calendar is stored in a database table containing IO Sessions. As we all know, Google wants us to use Loaders to get data from a database, so <code>mInitStarred</code> gets initialized in a <code>Loader</code> callback.¬π</p>
<p><code>mInitStarred</code> is used to determine whether its actually necessary to launch a <code>SessionCalendarService</code> to update the user‚Äôs calendar to include or exclude a particular session. If the database tells us that a session is already a part of a user‚Äôs calendar and if the state of the plus button indicates that that‚Äôs what the user wants when they leave the <code>SessionDetailActivity</code>, then we don‚Äôt need to do anything.</p>
<p>So, if we‚Äôre testing <code>onStop()</code>, we want to make sure that it launches a Service that updates the user‚Äôs calendar according to the state of the plus button <em>only if</em> necessary. Unfortunately, because <code>mInitStarred</code>¬†is a private instance variable that‚Äôs initialized in a Loader callback, there is simply no way for us to change the value of mInitStarred from a unit test method. Again, to see this, let‚Äôs think through the ways that we alter an object‚Äôs pre-act-state state for a unit test.</p>
<p>The first way is to alter a publicly accessible property that affects the object‚Äôs pre-act-state:¬≤</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/kmdupr33/5979104560afac8b525d.js"></script>

<p>The second way is to change the parameters passed in to the method being tested:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/kmdupr33/ea00e4e2e2489a965317.js"></script>

<p>Again, neither of these two options are available to us, so we can‚Äôt even complete the arrange-step of a unit test for <code>onStop()</code>.¬†There is no publicly accessible property on <code>SeessionDetailActivity</code> that we can set to alter the value of <code>mInitStarred</code>. <code>onStop()</code>, moreover, doesn&rsquo;t take <code>mInitStarred</code> as a parameter, so we can&rsquo;t modify the pre-act-state by changing <code>onStop()</code>'s parameter value either.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>So, a piece of code that seems like it should be easy to unit test, turns out to be impossible to test. If you‚Äôve ever found yourself staring at <code>Activity</code> for hours trying to figure how to unit test some of its business logic, this is why: In many cases, it‚Äôs just not possible. It some cases, it may be impossible to complete the arrange-step of a test because you have no way of altering the test object‚Äôs pre-act-state. In other cases, you may not be able to complete the assert-step of your test because you can‚Äôt access relevant post-act-state. <code>onStop()</code> in <code>SessionDetailActivity</code> suffers from both of these problems.</p>
<p>There is plenty of Android code that is simply untestable. I think that the way we structure our applications, along with some special properties of Android platform, set us on a path to writing un-testable code. In <a href="http://philosophicalhacker.com/2015/04/24/why-android-unit-testing-is-so-hard-pt-2/"target="_blank">the next post</a>, I‚Äôll elaborate on this claim.</p>

<li>
<p>They push Loaders pretty hard in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrPoIF6A9gM"target="_blank">one of their videos for the¬†Udacity course on Android Development</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearly there‚Äôs multiple ways of doing this. If, for example, the pre-act-state is determined by a dependency of the object being tested, we can also modify pre-act-state by changing the dependency‚Äôs public property.</p>
