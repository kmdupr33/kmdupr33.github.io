      <description>This week‚Äôs TidyTuesday data set is basically the script for all of the Avatar: The Last Airbender episodes. I thought it‚Äôd be neat to build a language model from the script and use it to generate new sentences that plausibly sound like they belong in the Avatar universe. In this post, I‚Äôll quickly present some of the sentences generated from the model, and then I‚Äôll dive into how I obtained those results.</description>

      <description>Introduction I live in Orlando Florida, which is less than an hour away from Cape Canaveral. As you might imagine, visiting the space center and watching launches is a ‚Äúthing‚Äù we Orlando folks do fairly often.
I‚Äôve also been getting into R and data science recently via Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham‚Äôs excellent R for Data Science. To apply the things I‚Äôm learning, I thought it‚Äôd be fun to analyze this week‚Äôs Tidy Tuesday astronauts dataset.</description>

      <description>I bought a car recently. I‚Äôm cheap and practical and I‚Äôm going to be a father soon, so the only things I really cared about were:
 will the car keep my wife and child safe if they‚Äôre in an accident will the car keep running reliably how do I get üëÜ those two things on the cheap  I‚Äôve also been getting into machine learning and data science recently, so I thought it‚Äôd be useful to answer them using some data science tools.</description>
