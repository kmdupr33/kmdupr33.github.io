            <p class="note title">MVPR: A Flexible, Testable Architecture for Android (Pt. 1)</p><p class="note date">2015-07-07</p><p class="note content">Thorough unit testing helps us improve the internal quality because, to be tested, a unit has to be structured to run outside the system in a test fixture. A unit test for an object needs to create the object, provide its dependencies, interact with it, and check that it behaved as expected. So, for a class to be easy to unit-test, the class must have explicit dependencies that can easily be substituted and clear responsibilities that can easily be invoked and verified. In software engineering terms, that means that the code must be loosely coupled and highly cohesive —in other words, well-designed. Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce, Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests
Lately, I&rsquo;ve been working towards making Google&rsquo;s IO app unit testable. A part of the reason I&rsquo;m doing this is to test the claims that Freeman and Pryce make in the above quotation about unit testing. Although I&rsquo;m still not even done with refactoring one Activity in Google&rsquo;s IOSched app, I&rsquo;m already finding some truth to what they&rsquo;re saying.
The Activity that I&rsquo;ve been working on is the SessionDetailActivity. If you&rsquo;ve been following me for a while, you know exactly what Activity I&rsquo;m talking about, but if you&rsquo;re tuning in the first time, here&rsquo;s what the SessionDetailActivity UI looks like:
As I mentioned in the post that introduced this series, there have been several challenges to making the SessionDetailActivity unit testable. Unit testing its dynamically constructed views was a challenge that I discussed in my last post in this series, but in that post, I noted that my strategy for testing dynamically constructed views wasn&rsquo;t entirely clean because of a circular dependency between Views and Presenters.
This circular dependency is a symptom of a larger problem with how we structure our Android applications: both Activities and Presenters violate the principle of single responsibility. They are often responsible for at least two things: binding data to a View and responding to user input. This is a part of the reason why the SessionDetailActivity, a class that&rsquo;s supposed to serve as a model for Android development, is over 1000 lines long.
I think there&rsquo;s a better way to structure our applications. In the next few posts, I&rsquo;ll propose a new architecture that has the following properties:
It breaks up the multiple responsibilities typically handled by Presenters and Activities
It breaks the circular dependency that traditionally exists between Views on the one hand and Activities or Presenters on the other hand.
It enables us to use constructor dependency injection for all of our objects that present data to the user and respond to user input.
It makes our ui-related business logic classes easier to unit test, impossible to construct without the dependencies necessary to fulfill their responsibilities, and (slightly) more amenable to the use of composition and polymorphism to extend and/or modify object behavior.
In this post, I will try to give some reasons why we might consider a new architecture for Android development in the first place.

            <p class="note title">Taylor Swift, Photographers, and "working for nothing"</p><p class="note date">2015-06-25</p><p class="note content">If you don&rsquo;t already know, here&rsquo;s a quick run down of what&rsquo;s happening with the whole Taylor Swift/Apple/Indie Artists debacle: Last month, Apple released its streaming service and offered a three month trial period to users for free. During the trial period, they weren&rsquo;t planning on paying the artists whose music was streamed by the service. Last week, Taylor Swift published an open letter to Apple in which she basically claimed that Apple was wronging artists by not paying them for three months. Two days ago, Jason Sheldon produced a contract that he had to sign to photograph one of Swift&rsquo;s older tours, and because the contract allows for his work to be used indefinitely without compensating him for each use, he basically calls Swift a hypocrite. Swift&rsquo;s spokesman said that Sheldon is misrepresenting the contract. A few hours ago, Joel Goodman, another freelance photographer, leaked a contract for the 1989 tour that contains even stricter rules.
This debacle raises two philosophical questions:
Is Swift a hypocrite?
Have musicians like Swift or photographers like Sheldon even given a compelling argument for why they&rsquo;ve been treated wrongly in the first place?
I do think Swift is a hypocrite, but I don&rsquo;t think that it really matters because neither Swift nor Sheldon has given us a good reason to think that artists are being wronged by companies like Apple and Firefly Entertainment. Let me try to convince you to see things my way.

            <p class="note title">Introduction to RxJava for Android (Pt. 2)</p><p class="note date">2015-06-19</p><p class="note content">I concluded my last post by summing up what we&rsquo;ve seen so far and what we still need to understand about RxJava:
We now know what an asynchronous data stream is and we know that RxJava uses the Observer pattern to deliver these streams to everyone that’s interested. We still don’t know, however, what it means for a data stream to be “functionally transformed” nor do we know how RxJava allows us to represent anything as an asynchronous data stream that can be created and consumed on any thread. These are questions I’ll have to tackle in the second part of this written version of my upcoming RxJava talk. In this post, I&rsquo;ll fill in the missing gaps in our understanding of my initial statement of what RxJava allows us to do.

            <p class="note title">Unit Testing Dynamically Constructed Views</p><p class="note date">2015-06-06</p><p class="note content">Some view hierarchies in Android are specified statically. The structure of these hierarchies does not change at run-time. Occasionally, we need to have dynamically constructed view hierarchies, hierarchies whose structure change at run-time. We might need to, for example, add or remove a view depending on some data we&rsquo;ve fetched or in response to some input. The SessionDetailActivity in Google&rsquo;s IOSched app has a dynamically constructed view hierarchy. The number of tags associated with a particular IO session determines how many tag views are added to the SessionDetailActivity&rsquo;s view hierarchy.
In this screenshot, the &ldquo;Distribute,&rdquo; &ldquo;Android,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Games&rdquo; tags are added to the view hierarchy based on the tags associated with the &ldquo;Going global with Google Play&rdquo; IO session. In this post, I&rsquo;ll outline an approach that I used to write the code that is both unit testable and able to dynamically construct the SesisonDetailActivity&rsquo;s view hierarchy. This post is a part of a series of parts in which I discuss how we can take steps towards making Google&rsquo;s IOSched app unit testable.

More recently, I&rsquo;ve started to fill in the details of that proposal by forking the IOSched repo and refactoring it to make it unit testable. In the next few posts, I&rsquo;ll be discussing some of the challenges that arose when attempting to make the SessionDetailActivity unit testable within the IOSched app. In this post, I want to provide a broad overview of the challenges I&rsquo;ll be discussing.

Android 1.2 introduced unit testing support. Now, we can run junit tests on the jvm while we&rsquo;re developing our apps. During my talk, we&rsquo;ll discuss the following questions:
Why should anyone care about this new feature?
What the heck is unit testing anyways?
Briefly, I&rsquo;ll also mention some of the challenges of writing unit tests for Android.
