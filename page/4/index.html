        <p>Table-driven tests are a common testing pattern for go tests. Since I recently started working with gomock, I wondered if there was a way to use table-driven tests with gomock mocks. It turns out that this is definitely possible, and that&rsquo;s what this post is about. Before I show how to combine table-driven tests with gomock mocks, I briefly review how gomock and table-driven tests work and I try to show why you might want to combine table-driven tests with mocks in the first place. <a class="read-more" href="/post/table-driven-tests-with-gomock/">&raquo;</a></p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p><p>A few weeks ago, I started learning go. Since I&rsquo;m a wannabe TDD-er, I took a look at some resources on testing go code. I stumbled upon <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2014/testing.slide#1">Andrew Gerrand&rsquo;s excellent Testing Techniques talk</a> in which he says this:</p>

<blockquote>Go eschews a lot of things, including mocks and fakes.</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Alright cool,&rdquo; I thought to myself. I&rsquo;m down to &ldquo;do as the gophers do&rdquo; and eschew mocks. Later on during his talk, Andrew Gerrand mentions <a href="https://github.com/golang/mock">gomock</a>, a mocking library, and reluctantly says</p>

<blockquote>[mocking libraries like gomock] are fine, but I find that on balance the hand-written fakes tend be easier to reason about and clearer to see what's going on, but I'm not an enterprise go programmer so maybe people do need that so I don't know, but that's my advice.</blockquote>

<p>Of course, after hearing that, I felt a little confused and unsure whether I should refrain from using mocking libraries in go. To make matters worse, I took a look at gomock and was surprised to find that its written by two engineers at Google.</p>

<p>At that point, it seemed that the question of whether we should use a mocking library while testing go code is a bit of a contentious question, even within Google. I found the seeming contentious nature of this question pretty unhelpful and confusing when I was trying to get a handle on how to write good go code. However, it led me to do some research on the pros and cons of mocking libraries vs hand-written mocks, and in this post, I present the conclusions I came to based on my research:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The apparent contentiousness about whether to use use a mocking library if probably partially due to vague terminology.</p></li>

<li><p>If we are clear about our terms, the argument against using mocking libraries is not very compelling.</p></li>

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p><p>In my last post, I went over <a href="http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/2015/07/09/6-things-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-wrote-my-first-android-app/">6 things I wish I knew before I wrote my first Android app</a>. One of the things I listed in that post was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Don’t have static references to Contexts</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason I warned against this is that static references to Contexts can cause memory leaks. An astute reader pointed out that a static reference to an application Context wouldn&rsquo;t cause a memory leak since the application Context is around for the lifetime the app is running anyway. I then qualified my warning by saying:</p>

<blockquote>Note: Technically, you can hold a static reference to an application Context without causing a memory leak, but I wouldn’t recommend that you do that either.</blockquote>

<p>In this post, I want to say a little more about why think having and using a static reference to an application Context is <em>less-than-ideal</em>. I emphasize &ldquo;less-than-ideal&rdquo; in the previous sentence as a way of highlighting what I&rsquo;m not saying: I&rsquo;m not saying that a kitten dies every time you use a static reference to an application Context. Once again, @codestandards is hilarious and relevant here:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please, for the sake of the kittens. <a href="http://t.co/xaj7pNDVfH">pic.twitter.com/xaj7pNDVfH</a></p>&mdash; Code Standards (@codestandards) <a href="https://twitter.com/codestandards/status/570224843536277504">February 24, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Instead, all I&rsquo;m doing in this post is offering a few points that suggest that using static references to Contexts is probably not the cleanest way of coding Android apps. </p> <a class="read-more" href="/2015/07/14/why-static-references-to-application-contexts-are-probably-not-the-best-idea/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p><p>My first app was terrible. It was so terrible, in fact, that I removed it from the store and I don&rsquo;t even bother listing it on my resume&rsquo; anymore. That app wouldn&rsquo;t have been so terrible if I knew a few things about Android development before I wrote it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of things to keep in mind as you&rsquo;re writing your first Android apps. These lessons are derived from actual mistakes that I made in the source code of my first app, mistakes that I&rsquo;ll be showing below. Keeping these things in mind will help you write an app that you can be a little prouder of.</p>

<p>Of course, if you&rsquo;re doing your job right as a student of Android development, you&rsquo;ll probably hate your app later regardless. As @codestandards says,</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If the code you wrote a year ago doesn&#39;t seem bad to you, you&#39;re probably not learning enough.</p>&mdash; Code Standards (@codestandards) <a href="https://twitter.com/codestandards/status/601373392059518976">May 21, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an experienced Java developer, items 1, 2, and 5 probably won&rsquo;t be interesting to you. Items 3 and 4, on the other hand, might show you some cool stuff you can do with Android Studio that you might not have known about, even if you&rsquo;ve never been guilty of making the mistakes I demo in those items.

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p><p>In <a href="http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/2015/07/07/mvpr-a-flexible-testable-architecture-for-android-pt-1/">my last post</a>, I argued that there are two disadvantages to <code>Activities</code> and Presenters. The first disadvantage is that they are often bloated classes. The second disadvantage is that these classes often have a circular dependency between themselves and their Views. Yesterday, Hannes Dorfmann made a comment on my post that was so thoughtful and excellent that I think its worth dedicating an entire post to responding to it.</p>
