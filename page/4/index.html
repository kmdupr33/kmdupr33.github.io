 Some people don&rsquo;t think Dagger is very useful. I&rsquo;m a bit suspicious of these people. An application that doesn&rsquo;t need Dagger smells.

There are other tests that aren&rsquo;t so fast. Because they&rsquo;re slow, you don&rsquo;t want to run them often. You&rsquo;ve got better things to do than to sit and wait for test results to come through.
Unfortunately, the less you run your slow tests, the less valuable they are.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="note tag" href="/tags/android/">android</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/testing/">testing</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/ci/">ci</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/android-testing-calisthenics-domain-objects/">

Jake Wharton, Fragmented Episode 7, 1:12:00
 For a while now, anything security or crypto related on Android has been a black box for me. For example, when I read the docs on Android&rsquo;s KeyStore class or hear about Android&rsquo;s Fingerprint authentication functionality on Fragmented, I often feel like I&rsquo;m just barely understanding what&rsquo;s being said.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="note tag" href="/tags/android/">android</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/security/">security</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/why-im-skeptical-about-kotlin-coroutines-for-android-development/">

Kotlin&rsquo;s 1.1 release has experiment support for coroutines. Here&rsquo;s the elevator pitch for coroutines from their blog post announcing the release:
 Asynchronous programming is taking over the world, and the only thing that is holding us back is that non-blocking code adds considerable complexity to our systems. Kotlin now offers means to tame this complexity by making coroutines first-class citizens in the language through the single primitive: suspending functions.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="note tag" href="/tags/android/">android</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/rxjava/">rxjava</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/kotlin/">kotlin</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/coroutines/">coroutines</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/what-unit-tests-are-trying-to-tell-us-about-activities-pt-2/">

 God is dead&hellip;and also Context is dead.
&ndash;Friedrich Nietszche (probably)
 Godlessness in the context of OO-programming &ndash; unlike godlessness in a broader context &ndash; is uncontroversially a good thing. Some may want gods in school or gods in government, but &ndash; all other things being equal &ndash; no one really wants gods in their programs.
In android development specifically, we have a god that we all know and love to hate: Context.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="note tag" href="/tags/android/">android</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/testing/">testing</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/architecture/">architecture</a></p></li></ul><div class="pagination">
