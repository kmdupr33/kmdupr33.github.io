The result of his retreat was his Meditations on First Philosophy, one of the most important philosophical texts of the modern era and one of my personal favorites.
Early on in his Meditations, he decides that it&rsquo;d be useful to engage in a thought experiment.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/business/">business</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/psychology/">psychology</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/philosophy/">philosophy</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/push-notification-meditation/">

Some people continue smoking cigarettes because they are unaware of how bad it tastes.

 I&rsquo;ve given this a fair shake. I&rsquo;ve taken two years of classes, and I&rsquo;ve decided that programming is some tedious bullshit ðŸ’©.

I want to talk about some patterns, principles, and tools for testing react native applications. I&rsquo;m going to focus a lot on the &ldquo;patterns and principles&rdquo; part of the testing equation because, as we all know, the improper use of tools can actually be worse than not having those tools at all.

 Should new APIs created in 2018 be RESTful or be built using graphql or be something else entirely?

 Most web APIs and SPAs aren&rsquo;t actually RESTful. ðŸ˜¨ In fact, I&rsquo;ve never worked with a completely RESTful API.
