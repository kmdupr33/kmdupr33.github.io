          <h2>Your tests can be faster</h2>
          <p>
            Many teams recognize that because of how quickly unit tests can execute, unit tests should make up the majority of their test suite.<sup>1</sup> However, when they attempt to write unit tests for their code, they may not know where to start or their code may in fact be untestable. I help teams identify parts of their code base that are not amenable to unit testing and suggest refactoring methods that will make the code more unit testable.

          <h2>Your QA team can write functional tests</h2>
          <p>
            QA teams can perform important functions, even in a team that has a large automated test suite.<sup>2</sup> I can help make your QA team more effective by helping your developers create a testing DSL simple enough for your QA team to use in writing functional tests.

        <section class="tooling">
          <h2>Your Testing Process can be streamlined</h2>
          <p>
            Testing can often be a repetitive process. The way your team gets builds to QA, for example, may not be as efficient as it could be. I can help your team identify repettive tasks that are susceptible to automation.

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Speed is not the only reason we should prefer unit tests over functional UI tests. See <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html">this article</a> for more info.</li>
          <li>See <a href="https://assets.thoughtworks.com/podcast/is-tdd-dead-episode-3-20-may-2014.mp3">this discussion</a> between Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, and David Heinemeier Hansson for more on this.</li>
