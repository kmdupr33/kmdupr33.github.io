I know this because I recently implemented the read_schema_tables function below such that the following test passes:
import sqlite3 def test_read_table_names(db_file): con = sqlite3.connect(db_file) assert list(con.execute(&#34;SELECT * FROM sqlite_schema;&#34;)) == list(read_schema_tables(db_file)) read_schema_tables doesn&rsquo;t use the sqlite3 python package. That&rsquo;d make for a trivial test case and would be too easy. For comp sci fun, we have to do it the hard way.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

We think developers have seen enough data leaks to want a product like this, but we’re worried we’re wrong.
Even if we’re right, we’re worried about finding specific devs who can be early adopters. Where do these devs live? What languages do they use? What kind of companies do they work for?<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

Even more unbelievably, many of us &ldquo;justify&rdquo; our waste with vague appeals to &ldquo;clean code&rdquo; or &ldquo;best practices.&rdquo; I used to do this all the time.
These vague appeals — and the religious fervor that often accompanies them — betray a common lack of serious thinking about what makes code useful vs. wasteful. Instead, we have lots of shouting:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

Sam Altman&rsquo;s recent hyperbolic claim that Open AI has &ldquo;scientific certainty that GPT-5 will be better than GPT-4&rdquo; at Stanford University fuels this skepticism:
I&rsquo;m impressed by OpenAI, we use their models, and I&rsquo;m sure Sam is a nice guy, but I cannot imagine that whatever evidence they have to think GPT-5 will be better than GPT-4 would be enough for &ldquo;scientific certainty.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">How AI Startups Can Beat Incumbents</p><p class="note date">2024-04-12</p><p class="note content">There are lots of takes on where value will accrue as LLM-tech proliferates. Here’s one more.
“Where will value accrue?” — in case you’re not tuned into VC-speak — translates to “When can LLM startups beat incumbents?”
My answer: Startups with LLM-enabled, counter-positioned pricing will beat incumbents. They have the giant-defeating potential that David did.
What’s “counter-positioned pricing?” It’s a pricing model that incumbents can’t copy without losing money.
The classic example1 of counter-positioning is Vanguard index funds.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Under Appreciated Benefits of Selling to Startups</p><p class="note date">2024-04-05</p><p class="note content">Unusual’s Startup Field Guide says:
We’ve found startups to be less optimal design partners&hellip;While they have extreme urgency and can certainly move quickly, they lack the stability and consistency that a [larger] company has. In addition, they often have small budgets and a high propensity to “DIY.” They are often consumed with their own challenges and feedback so you can easily get lost in the shuffle.
We’re trying to make startups our design partners and early customers in spite of advice like this.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

Mocks, demo videos, and even ugly prototypes aren’t enough anymore. Others have made the same claim.1
They’re wrong. There are lots of markets where minimal MVPs are good enough, and if you aren’t in one of those markets, you may be better off pivoting instead of building a fancy MVP for picky customers who are flush with alternatives.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Look for billion dollar mistakes</p><p class="note date">2024-02-28</p><p class="note content">Successful startups grow so quickly that incumbents can’t catch up. Google couldn’t catch Facebook. Facebook couldn’t catch Instagram. Instagram couldn’t catch Snapchat. From each of these incumbent’s perspectives, the competitive startup’s success is actually a $1B+ strategic mistake.
This incumbent perspective leads to a novel approach for finding startup ideas. Instead of generating ideas by trying to be creative or visionary, we can just focus on flaws in human reasoning and knowledge and ask which of those flaws are likely to lead to $1B+ strategic errors.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

Although there are a few exceptions, generally speaking, no one will pay for it. Below I discuss the headwinds I encountered while trying to sell this product, headwinds that will affect anyone in the business of helping other software companies improve the UX of their product.
These headwinds aren’t worth fighting. Unless you’re offering a UX improvement that very obviously leads to more revenue, don’t get in to the UX business.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

When you’re building a B2B SaaS, you’re selling to employees and companies that can have conflicting incentives. When those conflicting incentives intersect with your value prop, you’ll face serious headwinds to growth, even if your solution drives revenue, cuts costs, or solves pain for an employee.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
