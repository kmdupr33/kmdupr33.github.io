The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.
LLMs are introducing something like this dynamic into programming. The programming version of the statement is:
The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the less experienced programmers are writing much more code than the more experienced ones.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/llms/">llms</a></p></li><li class="item">

Writing code is more fun than reading documentation. We tend to understimate the complexity of problems we don&rsquo;t understand well, so we undervalue libraries that solve these poorly understood problems. Perverse incentives: libraries compete with big internal engineering projects that look good in a promo packet. LLMs make this problem worse. Why? Less briefly:
Vibe coding is more fun than reading documentation. Shit, vibe-coding can be more fun than ordinary coding.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

We scrapped that idea when we discovered ChatGPT could trivially do this.
Here are some things we did to &ldquo;LLM-proof&rdquo; our new challenge.
But first, why the scare quotes around &ldquo;LLM-proof.&rdquo; Because I&rsquo;m sure someone could get an LLM to solve the new challenge, but the quality of prompting that would be necessary to pull this off would be an indication of a strong engineer.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Value-based pricing can be a trap for early startups</p><p class="note date">2024-10-03</p><p class="note content">Founders are often told to price based on the value they are providing to their customers. For example, if you&rsquo;re saving your customer 1 million dollars, charge a 10th of that. Here&rsquo;s Kevin Hale at YC advocating for this approach:
In startups, and almost pretty consistently across all businesses, everyone will tell you, you should strive for value-based pricing. It allows you to charge a whole lot more. It allows you to manipulate this incentive to buy.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Reading Sqlite Schema Tables the Hard Way</p><p class="note date">2024-09-25</p><p class="note content">Parsing a Sqlite database file is a nice way to brush up on data structures, bit manipulation, and recursion. I know this because I recently implemented the read_schema_tables function below such that the following test passes:
import sqlite3 def test_read_table_names(db_file): con = sqlite3.connect(db_file) assert list(con.execute(&#34;SELECT * FROM sqlite_schema;&#34;)) == list(read_schema_tables(db_file)) read_schema_tables doesn&rsquo;t use the sqlite3 python package. That&rsquo;d make for a trivial test case and would be too easy. For comp sci fun, we have to do it the hard way.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

We think developers have seen enough data leaks to want a product like this, but we’re worried we’re wrong.
Even if we’re right, we’re worried about finding specific devs who can be early adopters. Where do these devs live? What languages do they use? What kind of companies do they work for?<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

Even more unbelievably, many of us &ldquo;justify&rdquo; our waste with vague appeals to &ldquo;clean code&rdquo; or &ldquo;best practices.&rdquo; I used to do this all the time.
These vague appeals — and the religious fervor that often accompanies them — betray a common lack of serious thinking about what makes code useful vs. wasteful. Instead, we have lots of shouting:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

Sam Altman&rsquo;s recent hyperbolic claim that Open AI has &ldquo;scientific certainty that GPT-5 will be better than GPT-4&rdquo; at Stanford University fuels this skepticism:
I&rsquo;m impressed by OpenAI, we use their models, and I&rsquo;m sure Sam is a nice guy, but I cannot imagine that whatever evidence they have to think GPT-5 will be better than GPT-4 would be enough for &ldquo;scientific certainty.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

Sci-fi is a part of what guides my intuition here. Jarvis didn’t make GUIs obsolete for Tony Stark. GPT-X won’t make them obsolete for us.
Even if you don’t like sci-fi as a guide for the future, you can see that chat-based UIs won’t dominate it by looking closely at how we use computers today.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">How AI Startups Can Beat Incumbents</p><p class="note date">2024-04-12</p><p class="note content">There are lots of takes on where value will accrue as LLM-tech proliferates. Here’s one more.
“Where will value accrue?” — in case you’re not tuned into VC-speak — translates to “When can LLM startups beat incumbents?”
My answer: Startups with LLM-enabled, counter-positioned pricing will beat incumbents. They have the giant-defeating potential that David did.
What’s “counter-positioned pricing?” It’s a pricing model that incumbents can’t copy without losing money.
The classic example1 of counter-positioning is Vanguard index funds.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
