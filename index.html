We think developers have seen enough data leaks to want a product like this, but we’re worried we’re wrong.
Even if we’re right, we’re worried about finding specific devs who can be early adopters. Where do these devs live? What languages do they use? What kind of companies do they work for?<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

Even more unbelievably, many of us &ldquo;justify&rdquo; our waste with vague appeals to &ldquo;clean code&rdquo; or &ldquo;best practices.&rdquo; I used to do this all the time.
These vague appeals — and the religious fervor that often accompanies them — betray a common lack of serious thinking about what makes code useful vs. wasteful. Instead, we have lots of shouting:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

Sam Altman&rsquo;s recent hyperbolic claim that Open AI has &ldquo;scientific certainty that GPT-5 will be better than GPT-4&rdquo; at Stanford University fuels this skepticism:
I&rsquo;m impressed by OpenAI, we use their models, and I&rsquo;m sure Sam is a nice guy, but I cannot imagine that whatever evidence they have to think GPT-5 will be better than GPT-4 would be enough for &ldquo;scientific certainty.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

“Where will value accrue?” — in case you’re not tuned into VC-speak — translates to “When can LLM startups beat incumbents?”
My answer: Startups with LLM-enabled, counter-positioned pricing will beat incumbents. They have the giant-defeating potential that David did.
What’s “counter-positioned pricing?” It’s a pricing model that incumbents can’t copy without losing money.
The classic example1 of counter-positioning is Vanguard index funds.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

Google couldn’t catch Facebook. Facebook couldn’t catch Instagram. Instagram couldn’t catch Snapchat. From each of these incumbent’s perspectives, the competitive startup’s success is actually a $1B+ strategic mistake.
This incumbent perspective leads to a novel approach for finding startup ideas. Instead of generating ideas by trying to be creative or visionary, we can just focus on flaws in human reasoning and knowledge and ask which of those flaws are likely to lead to $1B+ strategic errors.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

When you’re building a B2B SaaS, you’re selling to employees and companies that can have conflicting incentives. When those conflicting incentives intersect with your value prop, you’ll face serious headwinds to growth, even if your solution drives revenue, cuts costs, or solves pain for an employee.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

ChatGPT is game-changing, and, more generally, language models may be the most important dev tool of our generation. (It takes some humility to admit this, as we&rsquo;re working on a dev tool for data scientists.)
But neither ChatGPT nor some larger descendent model will ever be able to write the most difficult pieces of our software given natural language descriptions of desired functionality. Here&rsquo;s my argument for this claim, drawing on observations from Fred Brooks&rsquo; &ldquo;No Silver Bullet&rdquo; and Eric Evans&rsquo; Domain Driven Design.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

We did something odd for Advent of Code this year: We solved a few challenges in javascript and then in PostgreSQL. We learned a few interesting things about SQL that we&rsquo;d like to share here.
Disclaimer: We did not complete all 25 days in SQL (judging by the links from this HN thread, it looks like pretty much no one did), but we still think the things we learned about SQL are useful and worth sharing, especially for non-experts.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/postgres/">postgres</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/javascript/">javascript</a></p></li></ul><div class="pagination">
