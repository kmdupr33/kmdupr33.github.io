To keep us from falling into this trap, product leaders often quote Steve Jobs:
 I think Henry Ford once said, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, &lsquo;A faster horse!'&rdquo; People don&rsquo;t know what they want until you show it to them.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/strategy/">strategy</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/roadmap-presentation-tips/">

In this interactive essay, I suggest we add another course to this list: statistics. A strong understanding of statistics facilitates three key responsibilities of product managment: understanding analytics, implementing cooprorate change, and making accurate forecasts.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/statistics/">statistics</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/analytics/">analytics</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/lost-local-optima/">

You can read more here.
The forecast I&rsquo;m making relates to this question:
 Will the percent change in iPhone revenue growth from Q1 2018 to Q1 2019 be greater than the percent change in revenue growth from Q4 2017 to Q4 2018?<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/business/">business</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/forecasting/">forecasting</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/big-disruption-review/">

&ldquo;Hilarious&rdquo; because the book is surprisingly funny. My wife actually kept commenting on how much I was chuckling as I read the book.
&ldquo;Heresy&rdquo; because it‚Äôs a good way of capturing what Powell is doing in the book with all of her criticisms: she‚Äôs challenging the silicon valley gospel that tech companies are here to save the world, and given all of the attention and good will towards those companies, ‚Äúheresy‚Äù feels like an appropriate label for this message.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/okr-problems/">

According to Marty Cagan, product managers should be especially interested in OKRs as a goal setting framework since they are a better way of tracking product work than a &ldquo;product roadmap.&rdquo; I agree with Cagan. OKRs are often better than typical product road maps.
However, there‚Äôs an aspect of OKRs that I think is morally and psychologically problematic: the idea that OKRs should be impossible to entirely achieve.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/business/">business</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/io-psychology/">io psychology</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/how-lean-became-profound/">

Eric Reis&rsquo; The Lean Startup and Marty Cagan&rsquo;s Inspired both come to mind. They&rsquo;re great books with lots of useful techniques and important ideas.
Lately, however, the fact that these books are popular and useful has struck me as rather odd. If you take a step back from these books &mdash; and the many books, articles, talks, podcasts, etc. like them &mdash; they really rest on a pretty simple idea:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/lean-startup/">lean startup</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/better-cohort-analysis/">

Graphs like this one depict cohort analyses.1 This particular graph is from Google Analytics. Apple also has one for app analytics. So does Fabric.2
Cohort analyses can be very useful.
