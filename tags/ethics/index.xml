      <title>On Selling your Soul: Notes on Gregg Pollack&#39;s Founder&#39;s Talk</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re going to be successful, Richard, you need to learn to be an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erlich Bachman, &lt;em&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, I was recently accepted into &lt;a href=&#34;http://starterstudio.com/&#34;&gt;Starter Studio&lt;/a&gt;, an Orlando-based incubator to work on &lt;a href=&#34;http://universityandroid.com&#34;&gt;University Android&lt;/a&gt;, a codeacademy-like program for learning Android development. Every Monday night, Starter Studio brings in successful founders to talk about things they&amp;rsquo;ve learned along the way to success. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that throughout my time at Starter Studio, I&amp;rsquo;d like to note two big &amp;ldquo;take aways&amp;rdquo; from each founder&amp;rsquo;s talk: one business-related and one personal. Here are my notes on Gregg Pollack&amp;rsquo;s talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Gregg Pollack, the founder of CodeSchool spoke. At the end of his talk, he invited us to connect with him on linkedin, and before moving on, he paused, smirked, and let us in on the &amp;ldquo;dark side&amp;rdquo; on his seemingly arbitrary linkedin invitation: he told us all that he wanted us to connect with him on linkedin so that he could add our emails to his mailing list for his new startup he&amp;rsquo;s working on. I think this little exchange pretty well characterizes the two things I took away from his talk: 1) a startup is a hustle; you have to be focused on sales and marketing, but 2) you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a complete asshole about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hustle&#34;&gt;The Hustle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take away one thing from this talk, know that 50% of building a startup is sales and marketing.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That statement was pretty surprising to me. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why, but I know that if its true, then I&amp;rsquo;m not spending nearly enough time on marketing and sales for my company. (To be frank, these founder&amp;rsquo;s talk notes are a partial remedy to that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that while working on University Android, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of a tough time transitioning from an engineering mindset to the mindset of an entrepreneur. I often find myself getting caught up in engineering issues that simply are not relevant &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; for my company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an engineer at an established company, you&amp;rsquo;re paid to write &lt;em&gt;scalable&lt;/em&gt; code. As a founder, on the other hand, you won&amp;rsquo;t get paid until you find a scalable business model. To be sure, the engineering solutions I come up with as a founder have to be scalable to some extent, but scalable solutions for founders are only good insofar as they allow them to find a scalable business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to spend more time hustling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-asshole&#34;&gt;The Asshole&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point during the talk, Gregg said something shocking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people think that all the money &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/26/online-learning-service-pluralsight-acquires-code-school-for-36-million/&#34;&gt;in the acquisition went to me&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s not true&amp;hellip;I was able to re-structure my ownership of the company before the acquisition to give more equity to the people who really worked hard on code school.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people say that they really value their employees, but I doubt that many of these people would do what Gregg did before the acquisition. I think that what he did was pretty remarkable. I may only think that because &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/2014/05/21/why-ill-probably-try-to-manipulate-you-2/&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just cynical about business&lt;/a&gt;. I am, after all, one of the people that often rolls their eyes at silicon&amp;rsquo;s valley&amp;rsquo;s fictitious companies (at the real ones they satirize) that always claim they want to &amp;ldquo;make the world a better place.&amp;rdquo; But I don&amp;rsquo;t think my cynicism is the only thing behind my judgment of Gregg&amp;rsquo;s generosity. Optimists, correct me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase &amp;ldquo;to sell your soul&amp;rdquo; typically has negative connotations, but if we play with our words a little, there&amp;rsquo;s another sense in which that phrase isn&amp;rsquo;t so negative. Founders pour &amp;ldquo;everything&amp;rdquo; into their startups. They often love their startups. We often say that &amp;ldquo;your startup is your baby.&amp;rdquo; In Arabic, a language that I, as a half-arab, have a little exposure to, one way of lovingly referring to your beloved is to say &amp;ldquo;you are my soul.&amp;rdquo; If we adopt this foreign idiom and Gregg&amp;rsquo;s advice about the importance of marketing for startups, then we can say &lt;em&gt;building a startup is largely the process of selling your soul.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be more optimistic and intentional about finding ways of selling my soul without selling my soul and becoming an asshole (See what I did there? Sure. The word play is cheesy and a bit forced, but how else was I supposed to make the point of this post work with my &amp;ldquo;click-bait&amp;rdquo; title ;) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m paraphrasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still paraphrasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Why I&#39;ll Probably Try to Manipulate You</title>
      <link>https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/2014/05/21/why-ill-probably-try-to-manipulate-you-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I became a hippie when I was a freshman in college. When I say I became a hippie, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean that I wore tie dye t-shirts all the time, smoked a lot of weed, and listened to &amp;ldquo;All you need is love&amp;rdquo; all day. I was a hippie even though I owned zero tie dye t-shirts, wasn&amp;rsquo;t cool enough to get invited to the weed parties, and had never heard that famous Beatles song that more conventional hippies love. Although I lacked the traditional trappings of a hippie, I became  hippie in a truer sense of the word:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was suspicious of &amp;ldquo;the system,&amp;rdquo; man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hippie readers know what &amp;ldquo;the system&amp;rdquo; is, but the rest of you will probably have to watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, a video that is more than a little responsible for my conversion experience. Since most of you will probably look at the 20 minute length time on that video and say, &amp;ldquo;yeah right. I&amp;rsquo;m not watching this,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll give you the readers digest version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are people with lots of money who are using morally questionable methods to retain and/or increase their profits. One of the morally questionable means by which &amp;ldquo;the system&amp;rdquo; keeps its profits rolling is to &lt;em&gt;manipulate&lt;/em&gt; consumers into purchasing products. The word &amp;ldquo;manipulate,&amp;rdquo; as I&amp;rsquo;m using it here, means to attempt to persuade someone in a way that circumvents their ability to make a rational decision about whether to engage in some behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;rational decision?&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t really know, but don&amp;rsquo;t get philosophical on me right now. Answering that question could take a lifetime for a philosopher like me, and we know enough about rational decisions to know that they aren&amp;rsquo;t motivated by ritual and the &lt;em&gt;manufactured&lt;/em&gt; emotional need to find satisfaction in the consumption of new products.¹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that a rational purchase, for example, is not one that is made because we happened to see a commercial featuring a girl with shirt low-cut enough to convince us that having the product will make us more masculine. We know, to take another example, that a rational decision is not one that&amp;rsquo;s caused by a team of people working all day to find just the right combination of sugar, salt, fat, food additives, and visually appealing color-combinations to get you to buy another pack of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=publix+frosted+sugar+cookies&amp;amp;es_sm=91&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=MR98U-bLGYTJsQSfoIEI&amp;amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&amp;amp;biw=1277&amp;amp;bih=695&#34;&gt;those delicious Publix cookies with icing on them&lt;/a&gt;. (Those jokers have had me on the hook since high school.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we sometimes fall prey to manipulation by clever marketing. That’s not quite the point of the story here. Let’s get back to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just about a year after I became a hippie, something else happened: I became a wannabe philosophy professor. So, with my hippie and philosophy powers combined, I was on a mission to shape the minds of young people, to blow the whistle on &amp;ldquo;the system,&amp;rdquo; and to inoculate them against the B.S. that we are exposed to on a daily basis.²&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the philosophy ship has sailed. I&amp;rsquo;m a wannabe hacker and entrepreneur now. I want to build a company that sells products, and, surprisingly, I’ve found that I’m willing to “trick” you into buying them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m joining “the system,” man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would a hippie-philosopher like me be willing to join “the system?” Well, it turns out that I’m also an abolitionist and a wannabe champion of the poor. I started &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/SAS.UCF&#34;&gt;a student group&lt;/a&gt; in undergrad that fought against human trafficking and I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ddwOhnTTquMFUteVE5cUpKb3c/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;my undergraduate thesis&lt;/a&gt; on our moral obligations to the world’s poor, and as I alluded to in my first post, I want to become the kind of person who has the desire and the &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt; to make significant dents in the problems of human trafficking and global poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having resources means having money. Having money potentially means doing a tech startup. If I play the startup game well, I will pick an idea for a product that you will like and I will probably market the idea in ways that won’t appeal to your rational faculties. I will &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.helpscout.net/blog/psychology-of-color/&#34;&gt;pick colors that will make it more likely that you’ll like my product&lt;/a&gt;. I will write silly, emotionally appealing blog posts with silly justifications for why you need my product. I will try to find cool people that you look up to so that you’ll feel like you’re missing out on a cool thing if you don’t have I’m selling. In short, I will try to be manipulative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes. Writing those words out makes me feel crappier than I anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its strange, moreover, that a hippie-philosopher like me would wind up making morally grey decisions like this, but I honestly think that the moral trade off here is worth it: I treat you as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative#The_Second_Formulation&#34;&gt;“mere means”&lt;/a&gt; to the end of health and freedom for the world’s poor. Sorry, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats&#34;&gt;millions of children are dying&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, I’m open to being wrong about this. It might turn out that manipulative marketing techniques aren’t a key piece of pulling off a startup. It might also turn out that manipulating folk for the sake of the world’s poor is not worth the trade off. If I’m wrong, maybe I won’t try to manipulate you, but if I&amp;rsquo;m right, at least you can&amp;rsquo;t say I didn’t warn you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking here of the quotation Annie brings up from Victor Lebow who said, after realizing the productive capacity of our economy post WWII, “Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and selling of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction in consumption&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real talk: I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie and say that &lt;a href=&#34;https://philosophicalhacker.com/2014/04/21/why-im-glad-my-dream-job-didnt-work-out/&#34;&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t also just stoked about the idea of getting paid to talk and read about interesting, abstract issues that have much less to do with our well-being&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Should the Idea Person get Extra Equity?</title>
      <link>https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/2014/04/24/should-the-idea-person-get-extra-equity/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 12:17:53 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/2014/04/24/should-the-idea-person-get-extra-equity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophicalhacker.com/2014/04/21/why-im-glad-my-dream-job-didnt-work-out/&#34;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt;, I have some ideas for a startup, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to start working on them.¹ Unfortunately, doing a startup raises a lot of questions that I, as a former wannabe philosophy professor, haven&amp;rsquo;t really considered. Since its probably not a good idea to dive in to a venture that I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand, it seems like I should spend some time wrestling with what we might call &amp;ldquo;startup questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wrestling with a startup question that I hope will be interesting to the startup community in general:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the &amp;ldquo;idea person&amp;rdquo; get more equity than the other co-founders &lt;em&gt;simply because&lt;/em&gt; the startup is based on her idea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we wrestle with this question, let me say a little more to clarify exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m asking here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m asking whether having a good idea is itself a sufficient reason to get more equity. In other words, I&amp;rsquo;m asking if all other contributions are equal among co-founders, should the idea co-founder get extra equity? Or, to put the question a third way, I&amp;rsquo;m wondering whether it would make sense to give a person some equity for coming up with a good startup idea even if that person contributed nothing else to the success of the startup.²&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conventional answer to this question seems to be &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;ldquo;³ Now, if it turns out that convention is correct and that the idea person should get some extra equity, this would be sweet for me because at this point, I suspect that I&amp;rsquo;ll be an idea person for my startup. Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m not convinced that I should get extra equity simply for having an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s are two reasons I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to call &amp;ldquo;moral dibs&amp;rdquo; on my extra idea-person-equity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel responsible for the generation of my startup ideas. I didn&amp;rsquo;t sit around and think hard about &amp;ldquo;problems&amp;rdquo; that I could solve with a company. The ideas just sort of came to me.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really do any work to generate my startup ideas, it feels weird to get rewarded for it. For me, being rewarded for one of my startup ideas would kind of feel like getting rewarded for having a bowel movement. My response to such a prize would be, &amp;ldquo;Thanks for the reward, but this shit sort of just happened.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corollary of this point is that I&amp;rsquo;d have no problem demanding extra equity if I put a lot of work into coming up with a good idea. If I, for example, researched the various problems that industries or individuals are facing and used this information to come up with a startup idea, then I&amp;rsquo;d feel totally justified in asking for equity. In this case, however, I&amp;rsquo;m not getting equity simply for having an idea. Rather, I&amp;rsquo;m getting equity for work that I put into generating a good idea.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason I&amp;rsquo;m not convinced I should get extra equity is that I haven&amp;rsquo;t really come across any solid arguments to the contrary. In fact, the only real argument I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered seems to go something like:  &amp;ldquo;Without the idea guy, the startup wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible, so the idea guy should definitely get more equity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s got to be more to this argument if its going to be compelling. As it stands, the argument seems to assume that if a person makes a startup possible, then that person should get equity. That assumption is probably false since presumably we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give equity to the idea guy&amp;rsquo;s parents, even though the startup wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible without the parent&amp;rsquo;s decision to bring an entrepreneur-child into the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those two reasons, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that the idea person should get extra equity. Some might see this as kind of a radical position. It probably is, but don&amp;rsquo;t be offended. I&amp;rsquo;ve only thought about this question for an hour and I&amp;rsquo;m not even a &amp;ldquo;real entrepreneur&amp;rdquo; yet, so I&amp;rsquo;m very open to being wrong about this.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Feel free to tell me I&amp;rsquo;m wrong or to tell me how you think about equity splits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check them out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.launchyourstudents.co&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tangoisfantastic.appspot.com&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The second idea is only half mine. The other half belongs to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/manuel.arredondo?fref=ts&#34;&gt;Manuel Arredondo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, idea people may have other qualities that will earn them a larger share of the equity, but I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in those qualities. It might turn out, for example, that idea people are often more passionate about their startups and that this passion helps them work harder than other co-founders. If idea people tend to work harder, then it seems clear that they should get more equity &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they work harder, but I&amp;rsquo;m not asking whether idea people who happen to work harder should get a higher equity share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 152nd page of his book &lt;em&gt;The Founder&amp;rsquo;s Dilemmas&lt;/em&gt;, Noam Wasserman reports that startups typically give the idea guy an extra 10-15% equity. Wasserman  suspects that a part of the equity is given for &amp;ldquo;past contributions&amp;rdquo; (including the idea itself) and part of the equity is given out of &amp;ldquo;recognition that the idea person might be more likely to contribute important additional ideas in the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html&#34;&gt;According to Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt;, this is actually how it usually happens. Elizabeth Gilbert also thinks that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius&#34;&gt;this is how ideas are generated for authors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its possible that there&amp;rsquo;s something fishing going on with this distinction. Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to address worries about this right now. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like my position, this distinction might be a good place to criticize me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the founders at Crimson Solutions seemed to make an argument like this. Wasserman, &lt;em&gt;The Founder&amp;rsquo;s Dilemmas&lt;/em&gt;, 152.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scare quotes are for readers who don&amp;rsquo;t really like how I&amp;rsquo;m defining &amp;ldquo;real entrepreneur&amp;rdquo; in this sentence. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to get philosophical. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to define the term &amp;ldquo;entrepreneur.&amp;rdquo; All I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say is that I&amp;rsquo;m not working full time on a startup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
