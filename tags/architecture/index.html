 Some people don&rsquo;t think Dagger is very useful. I&rsquo;m a bit suspicious of these people. An application that doesn&rsquo;t need Dagger smells.

 God is dead&hellip;and also Context is dead.
&ndash;Friedrich Nietszche (probably)
 Godlessness in the context of OO-programming &ndash; unlike godlessness in a broader context &ndash; is uncontroversially a good thing. Some may want gods in school or gods in government, but &ndash; all other things being equal &ndash; no one really wants gods in their programs.
In android development specifically, we have a god that we all know and love to hate: Context.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="note tag" href="/tags/android/">android</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/testing/">testing</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/architecture/">architecture</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/against-singletons-for-android-data-loading/">

You and your guests swat at it a few times, but no one manages to nail the sucker. You run into the house to grab a fly swatter, but you find that even if you wait for the fly to settle down somewhere, you can&rsquo;t quite smash it.
Frustrated and desperate, you decide to evacuate the party (and the state), get your hands on a nuke, and nuke the fly along with your backyard and neighborhood.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="note tag" href="/tags/android/">android</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/testing/">testing</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/loaders/">loaders</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/architecture/">architecture</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/tdd-is-greater-than-the-principle-of-single-responsibility/">

Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month
 Grand structures &ndash; whether they are conceptual, programmatic, or physical &ndash; require strong foundations.
