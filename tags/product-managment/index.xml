      <description>Product managers have to make bets on the future. If you think for a few seconds about the types of risk that product managers are charged with managing, this becomes obvious. Product managers &amp;mdash; as Marty Cagan points out &amp;mdash; must manage risk around:
  value risk (whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it) usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it) feasibility risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills and technology we have) business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business)   All of these require some betting on the future, but managing value risk and business viability risk in particular require forecasting that can be especially difficult to do.</description>
