 We all know that correlation isn’t causation, but when we’re assessing the impact of a feature we’ve just shipped or searching for an “aha moment” that leads to better retention, it’s easy to forget this. It’s tempting to look at the increased conversion rates of users who did X versus users who didn’t, and conclude that our feature is working or that we’ve found the “aha moment.</description>

      <description>I bought a car recently. I’m cheap and practical and I’m going to be a father soon, so the only things I really cared about were:
 will the car keep my wife and child safe if they’re in an accident will the car keep running reliably how do I get 👆 those two things on the cheap  I’ve also been getting into machine learning and data science recently, so I thought it’d be useful to answer them using some data science tools.</description>

      <description>When programming, always follow the camping rule: Always leave the code base healthier than when you found it.

In this interactive essay, I suggest we add another course to this list: statistics. A strong understanding of statistics facilitates three key responsibilities of product managment: understanding analytics, implementing cooprorate change, and making accurate forecasts.</description>
