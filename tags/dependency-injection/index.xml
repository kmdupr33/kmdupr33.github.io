      <description>When I hear the word &amp;ldquo;graph,&amp;rdquo; I always think of graphs on a cartesian coordinate system. That&amp;rsquo;s not what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about here. Perhaps the easiest way of introducing graphs is to look at a visual representation of one:
What are we looking at here? We see a set of objects represented by circles. The set is [6, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2].
We also see that a subset of those objects have some relationship to one another, which is represented by the lines.</description>
