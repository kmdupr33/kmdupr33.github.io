      <description>&amp;hellip;in software, feedback cycles tend to be on the order of months, if not years&amp;hellip;It’s during the full lifetime of a project that a developer gains experience writing code, source controlling it, modifying it, testing it, and living with previous design and architecture decisions during maintenance phases.

What are we looking at here? We see a set of objects represented by circles. The set is [6, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2].
We also see that a subset of those objects have some relationship to one another, which is represented by the lines.</description>
