      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a written version of my recent React Orlando talk:
I want to talk about some patterns, principles, and tools for testing react native applications. I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus a lot on the &amp;ldquo;patterns and principles&amp;rdquo; part of the testing equation because, as we all know, the improper use of tools can actually be worse than not having those tools at all.
Michael Scott&amp;rsquo;s misuse of the fork-lift in Daryl&amp;rsquo;s warehouse came to mind while I was pondering this truth, and it turns out there&amp;rsquo;s a gif of this exact moment in the show.</description>

Many of us have a similar reaction when we think of using react native at an IoT startup:
 Wait a minute. React Native is fine for light-weight apps, but IoT companies need apps that make heavy use of the phone&amp;rsquo;s hardware, so don&amp;rsquo;t use it in this situation.</description>
