      <description>Note: This post was originally published on heap&amp;rsquo;s blog and was co-written with Amanda Murphy
 We did something odd for Advent of Code this year: We solved a few challenges in javascript and then in PostgreSQL. We learned a few interesting things about SQL that we&amp;rsquo;d like to share here.
Disclaimer: We did not complete all 25 days in SQL (judging by the links from this HN thread, it looks like pretty much no one did), but we still think the things we learned about SQL are useful and worth sharing, especially for non-experts.</description>
