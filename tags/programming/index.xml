      <description>I almost gave up on becoming a programmer. I took two years of college-level programming in high school and I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly care for it. Although I did fairly well in those classes, at the time, I probably had something like the following thoughts about programming:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve given this a fair shake. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken two years of classes, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that programming is some tedious bullshit ðŸ’©. I need to find something else.</description>
