If you think for a few seconds about the types of risk that product managers are charged with managing, this becomes obvious. Product managers &mdash; as Marty Cagan points out &mdash; must manage risk around:
  value risk (whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it) usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it) feasibility risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills and technology we have) business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business)   All of these require some betting on the future, but managing value risk and business viability risk in particular require forecasting that can be especially difficult to do.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="note tag" href="/tags/product-managment/">product managment</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/business/">business</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/big-disruption-review/">

&ldquo;Hilarious&rdquo; because the book is surprisingly funny. My wife actually kept commenting on how much I was chuckling as I read the book.
&ldquo;Heresy&rdquo; because it‚Äôs a good way of capturing what Powell is doing in the book with all of her criticisms: she‚Äôs challenging the silicon valley gospel that tech companies are here to save the world, and given all of the attention and good will towards those companies, ‚Äúheresy‚Äù feels like an appropriate label for this message.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="note tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/okr-problems/">
            <p class="note title">Some problems with the impossibility of achieving OKRs</p><p class="note date">2019-03-01</p><p class="note content">In many ways, OKRs are a neat way of structuring goals for a company. According to Marty Cagan, product managers should be especially interested in OKRs as a goal setting framework since they are a better way of tracking product work than a &ldquo;product roadmap.&rdquo; I agree with Cagan. OKRs are often better than typical product road maps.
However, there‚Äôs an aspect of OKRs that I think is morally and psychologically problematic: the idea that OKRs should be impossible to entirely achieve.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="note tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/business/">business</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/io-psychology/">io psychology</a><a class="note tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/better-cohort-analysis/">

Graphs like this one depict cohort analyses.1 This particular graph is from Google Analytics. Apple also has one for app analytics. So does Fabric.2
Cohort analyses can be very useful.
