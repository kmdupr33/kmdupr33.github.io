      <description>Edit: James Shore, the guy who attempted to shame Uncle Bob on Twitter, has fairly pointed out that I&amp;rsquo;ve omitted some of the context that makes his shaming appear more reasonable. I&amp;rsquo;ve edited this post to include more of that context.
 Holy crap! In case you missed it, Uncle Bob got excoriated on Twitter earlier this week for a comment he made about the media&amp;rsquo;s coverage of the separation of immigrant children from their parents.</description>
