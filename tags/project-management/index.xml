      <description>Good programmers are good at forecasting. They can often predict roughly how long it&amp;rsquo;ll take to accomplish a particular programming task. They can also predict when and to what extent a project will see ROI from a particular technical investment.

In Superforecasters, the authors note that many experienced people are surprisingly bad at making forecasts and that time and experience often don&amp;rsquo;t make us any better.</description>

      <description>in all but small teams I typically recommend separate people for the separate roles [of product managment and project management]. But in every case I believe that developing strong project management skills is a big advantage for product managers â€“ at the least your product will get to market faster, and it could make the difference between getting your product shipped at all.
