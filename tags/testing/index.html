  DI is useful. It&rsquo;s great. It makes your code more flexible, testable, etc. Dagger? Also useful. Great.

  Remember those gimmicky fitness products that made you think you could &ldquo;get fit&rdquo; without actually going to the gym/dieting/etc? Because I live in Orlando and have seen the Carousel of Progress at the Magic Kingdom a bunch of times, the first example of this kind of gimmicky product that comes to mind is a thing called an &ldquo;exercise belt.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/testing/">testing</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/programming/">programming</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/patterns-principles-and-tools-for-testing-react-native-apps/">

I want to talk about some patterns, principles, and tools for testing react native applications. I&rsquo;m going to focus a lot on the &ldquo;patterns and principles&rdquo; part of the testing equation because, as we all know, the improper use of tools can actually be worse than not having those tools at all.
Michael Scott&rsquo;s misuse of the fork-lift in Daryl&rsquo;s warehouse came to mind while I was pondering this truth, and it turns out there&rsquo;s a gif of this exact moment in the show.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/testing/">testing</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/react/">react</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/react-native/">react native</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/setting-up-a-jenkins-pipeline-for-android-testing/">

There are other tests that aren&rsquo;t so fast. Because they&rsquo;re slow, you don&rsquo;t want to run them often. You&rsquo;ve got better things to do than to sit and wait for test results to come through.
Unfortunately, the less you run your slow tests, the less valuable they are.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/android/">android</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/testing/">testing</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/ci/">ci</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/android-testing-calisthenics-domain-objects/">

You know that exercising is good for your health, so you decide that you&rsquo;re going to take up running. Strangely, however, you also decide that you&rsquo;re going to begin your journey towards physical fitness by running a marathon tomorrow.
That&rsquo;s obviously a bad idea.
Less obviously, deciding to go from no experience with testing to writing tests for an already existing Android app is also a bad idea.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/android/">android</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/testing/">testing</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/test-driving-away-coupling-in-activities/">

  God is dead&hellip;and also Context is dead.
  &ndash;Friedrich Nietszche (probably)
 Godlessness in the context of OO-programming &ndash; unlike godlessness in a broader context &ndash; is uncontroversially a good thing. Some may want gods in school or gods in government, but &ndash; all other things being equal &ndash; no one really wants gods in their programs.
In android development specifically, we have a god that we all know and love to hate: Context.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/android/">android</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/testing/">testing</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/architecture/">architecture</a></p></li></ul><div class="pagination">
