In this interactive essay, I suggest we add another course to this list: statistics. A strong understanding of statistics facilitates three key responsibilities of product managment: understanding analytics, implementing cooprorate change, and making accurate forecasts.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/statistics/">statistics</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/analytics/">analytics</a></p></li><li class="item">

You can read more here.
The forecast I&rsquo;m making relates to this question:
Will the percent change in iPhone revenue growth from Q1 2018 to Q1 2019 be greater than the percent change in revenue growth from Q4 2017 to Q4 2018?<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/business/">business</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/forecasting/">forecasting</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">The Cassandra Project: Towards Better Product Management via Better Forecasting</p><p class="note date">2019-03-30</p><p class="note content">Product managers have to make bets on the future. If you think for a few seconds about the types of risk that product managers are charged with managing, this becomes obvious. Product managers &mdash; as Marty Cagan points out &mdash; must manage risk around:
value risk (whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it) usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it) feasibility risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills and technology we have) business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business) All of these require some betting on the future, but managing value risk and business viability risk in particular require forecasting that can be especially difficult to do.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-managment/">product managment</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/business/">business</a></p></li><li class="item">

&ldquo;Hilarious&rdquo; because the book is surprisingly funny. My wife actually kept commenting on how much I was chuckling as I read the book.
&ldquo;Heresy&rdquo; because it‚Äôs a good way of capturing what Powell is doing in the book with all of her criticisms: she‚Äôs challenging the silicon valley gospel that tech companies are here to save the world, and given all of the attention and good will towards those companies, ‚Äúheresy‚Äù feels like an appropriate label for this message.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Some problems with the impossibility of achieving OKRs</p><p class="note date">2019-03-01</p><p class="note content">In many ways, OKRs are a neat way of structuring goals for a company. According to Marty Cagan, product managers should be especially interested in OKRs as a goal setting framework since they are a better way of tracking product work than a &ldquo;product roadmap.&rdquo; I agree with Cagan. OKRs are often better than typical product road maps.
However, there‚Äôs an aspect of OKRs that I think is morally and psychologically problematic: the idea that OKRs should be impossible to entirely achieve.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/business/">business</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/io-psychology/">io psychology</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a></p></li><li class="item">

Eric Reis&rsquo; The Lean Startup and Marty Cagan&rsquo;s Inspired both come to mind. They&rsquo;re great books with lots of useful techniques and important ideas.
Lately, however, the fact that these books are popular and useful has struck me as rather odd. If you take a step back from these books &mdash; and the many books, articles, talks, podcasts, etc. like them &mdash; they really rest on a pretty simple idea:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/lean-startup/">lean startup</a></p></li><li class="item">

Graphs like this one depict cohort analyses.1 This particular graph is from Google Analytics. Apple also has one for app analytics. So does Fabric.2
Cohort analyses can be very useful. For example, Eric Reis, in The Lean Startup, recounts how cohort analysis helped his startup realize that their efforts at improving their product weren&rsquo;t working:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/analytics/">analytics</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a></p></li><li class="item">

Here I go.
Improvement isn&rsquo;t Perfectly Linear So it turns out that in spite of my goal to meditate every day this past year, I only actually managed to meditate ~ 273 out of 365 days (almost 75%).<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/meditation/">meditation</a></p></li><li class="item">
