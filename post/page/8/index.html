Yesterday, I found out that there&rsquo;s an SICP study group. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to study SICP for a while now, so naturally I joined. What follows are my thoughts and key take-aways from sections 1.1.1-1.1.7.
Declarative vs. Procedural Knowledge Abelson et al. open the book with a really interesting distinction between declarative and procedural knowledge. Moreover, they suggest that the most significant achievement of computer science is that it provides a way for us to study procedural knowledge.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="note tag" href="/tags/sicp/">sicp</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/testing-package-implmentation-details-from-the-outside/">
            <p class="note title">Testing Package Implementation from 'the Outside'</p><p class="note date">2016-02-03</p><p class="note content">Sometimes you need to test a package&rsquo;s implementation from outside of the package containing the implementation you&rsquo;d like to test. This post briefly covers why this need arises and how we can meet that need. Much of the information here is already covered in Andrew Gerrand&rsquo;s testing techniques talk, so if you&rsquo;ve watched that, you&rsquo;ll probably only think the last section of this post is interesting.
Why?

Since I recently started working with gomock, I wondered if there was a way to use table-driven tests with gomock mocks. It turns out that this is definitely possible, and that&rsquo;s what this post is about. Before I show how to combine table-driven tests with gomock mocks, I briefly review how gomock and table-driven tests work and I try to show why you might want to combine table-driven tests with mocks in the first place.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="note tag" href="/tags/go/">go</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/integration-tests-in-go/">

For example, it may not be immediately obvious how you would go about writing and running integration tests in go. This post contains info on how to write and run integration tests for your go code.

            <p class="note title">Getting started with Gomock</p><p class="note date">2016-01-20</p><p class="note content">In my last post, I talked about why I started using gomock, a mocking library that facilitates testing in go. If you found what I said in that post at all compelling, you might have decided to give gomock a try and you might have noticed that the documentation isn&rsquo;t as helpful as it could be. This post is meant to supplement the documentation. It&rsquo;s a brief tutorial on how to get started with gomock.

            <p class="note title">Should we use mocking libraries for go testing?</p><p class="note date">2016-01-14</p><p class="note content">A few weeks ago, I started learning go. Since I&rsquo;m a wannabe TDD-er, I took a look at some resources on testing go code. I stumbled upon Andrew Gerrand&rsquo;s excellent Testing Techniques talk in which he says this:
Go eschews a lot of things, including mocks and fakes. &ldquo;Alright cool,&rdquo; I thought to myself. I&rsquo;m down to &ldquo;do as the gophers do&rdquo; and eschew mocks. Later on during his talk, Andrew Gerrand mentions gomock, a mocking library, and reluctantly says
[mocking libraries like gomock] are fine, but I find that on balance the hand-written fakes tend be easier to reason about and clearer to see what's going on, but I'm not an enterprise go programmer so maybe people do need that so I don't know, but that's my advice. Of course, after hearing that, I felt a little confused and unsure whether I should refrain from using mocking libraries in go. To make matters worse, I took a look at gomock and was surprised to find that its written by two engineers at Google.
At that point, it seemed that the question of whether we should use a mocking library while testing go code is a bit of a contentious question, even within Google. I found the seeming contentious nature of this question pretty unhelpful and confusing when I was trying to get a handle on how to write good go code. However, it led me to do some research on the pros and cons of mocking libraries vs hand-written mocks, and in this post, I present the conclusions I came to based on my research:
 The apparent contentiousness about whether to use use a mocking library if probably partially due to vague terminology.
 If we are clear about our terms, the argument against using mocking libraries is not very compelling.

This post (and the ones that will likely follow it) share a little bit about some of the techniques I used to follow a TDD-based work-flow for developing this application. It also discusses the architecture that arises when Android apps are built with testability in mind from the ground up.

            <p class="note title">Why Having Global Static References to Application Contexts is Probably not the Best Idea</p><p class="note date">2015-07-14</p><p class="note content">In my last post, I went over 6 things I wish I knew before I wrote my first Android app. One of the things I listed in that post was this:
  Don’t have static references to Contexts   The reason I warned against this is that static references to Contexts can cause memory leaks. An astute reader pointed out that a static reference to an application Context wouldn&rsquo;t cause a memory leak since the application Context is around for the lifetime the app is running anyway. I then qualified my warning by saying:
Note: Technically, you can hold a static reference to an application Context without causing a memory leak, but I wouldn’t recommend that you do that either. In this post, I want to say a little more about why think having and using a static reference to an application Context is less-than-ideal. I emphasize &ldquo;less-than-ideal&rdquo; in the previous sentence as a way of highlighting what I&rsquo;m not saying: I&rsquo;m not saying that a kitten dies every time you use a static reference to an application Context. Once again, @codestandards is hilarious and relevant here:

&mdash; Code Standards (@codestandards) February 24, 2015  Instead, all I&rsquo;m doing in this post is offering a few points that suggest that using static references to Contexts is probably not the cleanest way of coding Android apps.

            <p class="note title">6 Things I wish I Knew before I Wrote my first Android App</p><p class="note date">2015-07-09</p><p class="note content">My first app was terrible. It was so terrible, in fact, that I removed it from the store and I don&rsquo;t even bother listing it on my resume&rsquo; anymore. That app wouldn&rsquo;t have been so terrible if I knew a few things about Android development before I wrote it.
Here&rsquo;s a list of things to keep in mind as you&rsquo;re writing your first Android apps. These lessons are derived from actual mistakes that I made in the source code of my first app, mistakes that I&rsquo;ll be showing below. Keeping these things in mind will help you write an app that you can be a little prouder of.
Of course, if you&rsquo;re doing your job right as a student of Android development, you&rsquo;ll probably hate your app later regardless. As @codestandards says,
If the code you wrote a year ago doesn&#39;t seem bad to you, you&#39;re probably not learning enough.
&mdash; Code Standards (@codestandards) May 21, 2015  If you&rsquo;re an experienced Java developer, items 1, 2, and 5 probably won&rsquo;t be interesting to you. Items 3 and 4, on the other hand, might show you some cool stuff you can do with Android Studio that you might not have known about, even if you&rsquo;ve never been guilty of making the mistakes I demo in those items.

The first disadvantage is that they are often bloated classes. The second disadvantage is that these classes often have a circular dependency between themselves and their Views. Yesterday, Hannes Dorfmann made a comment on my post that was so thoughtful and excellent that I think its worth dedicating an entire post to responding to it.
