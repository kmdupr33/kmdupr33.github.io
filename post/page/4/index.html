            <p class="note title">Some problems with the impossibility of achieving OKRs</p><p class="note date">2019-03-01</p><p class="note content">In many ways, OKRs are a neat way of structuring goals for a company. According to Marty Cagan, product managers should be especially interested in OKRs as a goal setting framework since they are a better way of tracking product work than a &ldquo;product roadmap.&rdquo; I agree with Cagan. OKRs are often better than typical product road maps.
However, there’s an aspect of OKRs that I think is morally and psychologically problematic: the idea that OKRs should be impossible to entirely achieve.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/business/">business</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/io-psychology/">io psychology</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">How The Lean Principle Became Profound</p><p class="note date">2019-02-02</p><p class="note content">There are certain books that are required reading for product managers. Eric Reis&rsquo; The Lean Startup and Marty Cagan&rsquo;s Inspired both come to mind. They&rsquo;re great books with lots of useful techniques and important ideas.
Lately, however, the fact that these books are popular and useful has struck me as rather odd. If you take a step back from these books &mdash; and the many books, articles, talks, podcasts, etc. like them &mdash; they really rest on a pretty simple idea:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/lean-startup/">lean startup</a></p></li><li class="item">

Graphs like this one depict cohort analyses.1 This particular graph is from Google Analytics. Apple also has one for app analytics. So does Fabric.2
Cohort analyses can be very useful. For example, Eric Reis, in The Lean Startup, recounts how cohort analysis helped his startup realize that their efforts at improving their product weren&rsquo;t working:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/analytics/">analytics</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/product-management/">product management</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a></p></li><li class="item">

I wanted to jot down some miscellaneous thoughts about the journey that I haven&rsquo;t already covered in my posts about meditation, startups, and leadership or my post about meditation, addiction, and smart phones. Here I go.
Improvement isn&rsquo;t Perfectly Linear So it turns out that in spite of my goal to meditate every day this past year, I only actually managed to meditate ~ 273 out of 365 days (almost 75%).<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/meditation/">meditation</a></p></li><li class="item">

Here are some ways I think this passion can make us worse at what we do:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/programming/">programming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/startups/">startups</a></p></li><li class="item">

The result of his retreat was his Meditations on First Philosophy, one of the most important philosophical texts of the modern era and one of my personal favorites.
Early on in his Meditations, he decides that it&rsquo;d be useful to engage in a thought experiment.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/business/">business</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/psychology/">psychology</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/philosophy/">philosophy</a></p></li><li class="item">

Some people continue smoking cigarettes because they are unaware of how bad it tastes.
Although it was counter-intuitive, I had pretty good reason to believe it, as it was suggested by Judson Brewer, a psychiatrist who developed a mindfulness-based smoking cessation program that&rsquo;s supposedly superior to the standard one developed by the American Lung Association. 😮<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/meditation/">meditation</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/philosophy/">philosophy</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/psychology/">psychology</a></p></li><li class="item">

I took two years of college-level programming in high school and I didn&rsquo;t particularly care for it. Although I did fairly well in those classes, at the time, I probably had something like the following thoughts about programming:
I&rsquo;ve given this a fair shake. I&rsquo;ve taken two years of classes, and I&rsquo;ve decided that programming is some tedious bullshit 💩. I need to find something else.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/programming/">programming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/teaching/">teaching</a></p></li><li class="item">

I&rsquo;ve edited this post to include more of that context.
Holy crap!

Here are 2 trends that really stood out to me from this year&rsquo;s report, along with some commentary.
1. The End of Mobile&rsquo;s Golden Era Mobile&rsquo;s growth has been slowing for years and others have already noted the effects of this.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
