        <p>A few weeks ago, the folks working on Kotlin announced the 1.1 release. Kotlin&rsquo;s 1.1 release has experiment support for coroutines. Here&rsquo;s the elevator pitch for coroutines from their blog post announcing the release:
 Asynchronous programming is taking over the world, and the only thing that is holding us back is that non-blocking code adds considerable complexity to our systems. Kotlin now offers means to tame this complexity by making coroutines first-class citizens in the language through the single primitive: suspending functions. <a class="read-more" href="/post/why-im-skeptical-about-kotlin-coroutines-for-android-development/">&raquo;</a></p>

 God is dead&hellip;and also Context is dead.
&ndash;Friedrich Nietszche (probably)
 Godlessness in the context of OO-programming &ndash; unlike godlessness in a broader context &ndash; is uncontroversially a good thing. Some may want gods in school or gods in government, but &ndash; all other things being equal &ndash; no one really wants gods in their programs.
In android development specifically, we have a god that we all know and love to hate: Context. <a class="read-more" href="/post/towards-godless-android-development-how-and-why-i-kill-god-objects/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As a profession, we also tend to be abysmally ignorant of our own history.
David West, Object Thinking
 Almost two years ago, I wrote a couple articles that attempted to answer the question, &ldquo;Why is testing Android apps so hard?&rdquo; In those posts, I suggested that the standard architecture of Android applications is what makes testing difficult. This explanation of the difficulty of testing android apps raises a deeper, more historical question: why did an architecture that makes testing difficult became the default way of building Android apps in the first place? <a class="read-more" href="/post/why-android-testing-is-so-hard-historical-edition/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Imagine for a moment that there&rsquo;s an annoying fly buzzing around your guests at a BBQ you&rsquo;re hosting. You and your guests swat at it a few times, but no one manages to nail the sucker. You run into the house to grab a fly swatter, but you find that even if you wait for the fly to settle down somewhere, you can&rsquo;t quite smash it.
Frustrated and desperate, you decide to evacuate the party (and the state), get your hands on a nuke, and nuke the fly along with your backyard and neighborhood. <a class="read-more" href="/post/against-singletons-for-android-data-loading/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As I pointed out throughout my series of posts on writing testable Android applications, the key to writing testable Android apps, is creating and exploiting seams.
