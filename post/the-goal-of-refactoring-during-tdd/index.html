    <h1 class="article title">The goal of refactoring During TDD</h1><p class="article date">2016-10-16</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>Red, green, refactor. That&rsquo;s the TDD flow. That much was obvious to me.</p>

<p>However, refactoring is a pretty broad term. There are many reasons you may want to refactor code and as a result of this, I didn&rsquo;t really understand what exactly was supposed to happen during the refactor step of the TDD loop until I finished the first part of Kent Beck&rsquo;s <em>TDD by Example.</em></p>

<p>Actually, in the first description of TDD, Beck uses a more helpful description of the &ldquo;refactor step.&rdquo; After getting our tests to pass, he says that we should &ldquo;<em>refactor to remove duplication.</em>&rdquo; This is helpful, as it restricts the reasons we might refactor a piece of code while working. I&rsquo;ve sometimes found myself deep down a rabbit-hole of refactoring. This restriction gives me a principled way of determining what I should refactoring.</p>

<p>(As a bit of an aside, it was interesting to see how Beck recommends that we write down the tasks that need to be accomplished in a kind of todo-list. I wonder if I could leverage the TODO feature in most ideas to create this kind of todo-list)</p>

<p>The reason duplication is targeted for elimination is because duplication is indicative of dependency between the code and the test, which means that you can&rsquo;t change one without the other. This thwarts the TDD flow, which demands that after we get a test passing we, we want to write another test that &ldquo;&lsquo;makes sense&rsquo; to us without having to change the code.&rdquo; Beck makes this point even more explicit by saying this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By eliminating duplication before we go on to the next test, we maximize our chance of being able to get the next test running with one and only one change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing that&rsquo;s been really interesting about reading Beck&rsquo;s take on TDD is that he really emphasizes how TDD enables us to make progress through <em>very</em> small changes. More on that in a second.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing about Beck&rsquo;s take on duplication is how he recommends we spot it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Duplication most often takes the form of duplicate logicâ€”the same expression appearing in multiple places in the code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I first read this, I thought spotting duplication would merely involve looking for identical if-then statements, but Beck sees duplication in similar <em>expressions</em>, even if those expressions aren&rsquo;t expressed in code in identical ways:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Usually you see duplication between two pieces of code, but here the duplication is between the data in the test and the data in the code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We see this in his refactoring of the first test he writes. Here&rsquo;s the test code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">public</span> void testMultiplication() {
   Dollar five= <span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">new</span> Dollar(5);
   five.<span style="color:#007f7f">times</span>(2);
   assertEquals(10, five.<span style="color:#007f7f">amount</span>);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>And the model code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">class</span> Dollar {
  <span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">int</span> amount = 10;  
}</code></pre></div>

<p>He reveals the duplication by pointing out that we set <code>amount</code> equal to <code>10</code> because we&rsquo;ve multiplied <code>5</code> by <code>2</code> in our heads to get the test to pass quickly. If we write our assigmnet of <code>amount</code> as <code>int amount = 5 * 2</code>, we see that <code>5</code> and <code>2</code> appear in both the model code and in the test code. That&rsquo;s duplication that&rsquo;s got to go.</p>

<p>The step that Beck takes towards eliminating the duplication is small and it doesn&rsquo;t even really eliminate the duplication:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">class</span> Dollar {  
  <span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">void</span> times() {
    amount = 5 * 2;
  }
}</code></pre></div>

<p>He then says something interesting about TDD and the size of the step he took:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do these steps seem too small to you? Remember, TDD is not about taking teeny-tiny steps, it&rsquo;s about being able to take teeny-tiny steps. Would I code day-to-day with steps this small? No. But when things get the least bit weird, I&rsquo;m glad I can&hellip;If you can make steps too small, you can certainly make steps the right size. If you only take larger steps, you&rsquo;ll never know if smaller steps are appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is interesting, and it points to an issue related to getting stuck down a rabbit-hole of refactoring. I think a part of the reason this rabbit-hole happens, especially during Android development, is because we don&rsquo;t have the tests in place to make very small steps. (Although, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it happened more often in my case due to lack of discipline.) An inability to make small changes is a huge bummer because if something breaks, your search space for tracking down the bug is going to be large in proportion to the number of changes you&rsquo;ve made.</p>
