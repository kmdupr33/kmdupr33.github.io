<p>Me: I really like my new job.</p>

<p>Family: (incredulously) Really?</p>

<p>Me: Yeah. The people are smart, passionate, and the company seems promising.</p>

<p>Family: (sarcastically) Ok. So you&rsquo;ll stick around for 6 months then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two Wednesdays ago marked my 1 year anniversary at UniKey, and as the above dialog suggests, this is pretty weird for me. I&rsquo;ve never been at a job for a year before, so this 1st ever anniversary in my career has given me the urge to reflect a bit on a couple of questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why was UniKey the first place I&rsquo;ve stuck around this long?</li>
<li>What have I learned in the past year by sticking around?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-unikey">Why UniKey?</h3>

<p>A big part of why I&rsquo;ve stuck around at UniKey has to do with the fantastic people and culture at UniKey. My words can&rsquo;t really do justice for how great the work environment, people, and culture are there, but this video does a great job of capturing it:</p>

</div>


<hr />

<p>When I reflect on the fact that I came to UniKey after failing to start my own business, another reason why I&rsquo;ve stuck around this long becomes clear: UniKey has been a good place for me to learn lessons I need to know to have a better second crack at starting a business.</p>

<p>This reason for why I&rsquo;ve stuck around actually dovetails nicely with the second question my unusual anniversary has prompted me to ask.</p>

<h3 id="what-have-i-learned">What Have I Learned?</h3>

<p>This year has largely been about the struggle between my &ldquo;inner hacker&rdquo; &ndash; the part of me that wants to write beautiful code with the best tools and my &ldquo;inner hustler&rdquo; &ndash; the part of me that wants to build and be a part of successful businesses. In the last year, I&rsquo;ve started to identify and shed some of my hacker ways that interfere with my hustler aspirations.</p>

<h4 id="generalists-specialists-even-at-50-employees">Generalists &gt; Specialists, even at 50+ employees</h4>

<p>Its basically a truism that at startups, you wear many hats.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> I knew that coming into UniKey, but because my inner hacker didn&rsquo;t want to look up from my monitor, I didn&rsquo;t notice that this can be true even at startups with 50+ people.</p>

<p>Sometimes the best thing I can do is to take off my android dev hat and be an iOS or web dev for a few hours. Sometimes I should take off my hacker hat entirely and be a graphic designer or a copy writer or a project manager for a few hours. Sometimes I even need to get on a call with a partner to really understand what they want and what they&rsquo;re afraid of.</p>

<h4 id="don-t-put-the-cart-before-the-horse">Don&rsquo;t put the cart before the horse</h4>

<p>My inner hacker wants to build scalable, flexible code and infrastructure. This is great, but it&rsquo;s unhelpful if the business dies waiting for me to build a masterpiece. <em>Sometimes</em> the game is to write garbage, shed a tear, and move on because&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="technical-debt-probably-isn-t-going-to-kill-a-company">Technical debt probably isn&rsquo;t going to kill a company</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read a few things this year that suggest this<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> and I&rsquo;ve seen at UniKey that there are often far bigger dangers for a startup than, for example, untested code.</p>

<h3 id="two-years">Two years?!</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned and the people I&rsquo;ve worked with this past year, and I hope that in my second year, I can keep growing into the kind of person who understands how to play the startup game well. If that happens, I&rsquo;ll shock my family (and to some extent, myself) by sticking around for a whopping 2 years at a company. ;)</p>
